# Interactive Fictional Character Chatbot

This repository contains a chatbot model that enables interactive conversations with fictional characters and provides a realistic impersonation of a specific public figure's persona. The chatbot utilizes the GPT-2 language model, trained on a diverse corpus of textual data, including an autobiography and memoir, consisting of over 50,000 sentences.

## Features

- Interactive conversations with fictional characters: Engage in seamless and dynamic conversations with various fictional characters through the intuitive web interface.
- Realistic impersonation of a public figure: Experience a chatbot persona that convincingly imitates the speech and mannerisms of a specific public figure.
- Dialogue generation optimization: The language model has been fine-tuned to prioritize dialogue generation and character-specific responses, enhancing the authenticity and coherence of the conversations.

## Technologies Used

- Beautiful Soup: Used for web scraping to gather data from relevant sources.
- NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit): Utilized for text preprocessing and cleaning.
- TensorFlow: Employed as the machine learning framework for training the GPT-2 language model.
- Hugging Face: Leveraged for model deployment and integration with the Flask web framework.
- Flask: Used to develop an intuitive web interface for users to engage in conversations with fictional characters.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/repository.git`
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the Flask web application: `python app.py`
4. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000` to access the chatbot interface.

## Model Training and Fine-tuning

1. Preprocess the textual data: Apply text cleaning techniques using NLTK, remove irrelevant content, and split the data into sentences.
2. Train the GPT-2 language model: Utilize TensorFlow and the Hugging Face library to train the language model on the preprocessed dataset.
3. Fine-tune the model: Optimize the model for dialogue generation and character-specific responses using the collected dataset.
4. Save the trained model: Store the trained model and its associated weights for deployment in the web application.
