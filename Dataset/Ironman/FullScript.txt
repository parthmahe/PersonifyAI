Tony Stark: I feel like you're driving me to a court-martial. This is crazy. What did I do? I feel like you're going to pull over and snuff me. What, you're not allowed to talk? Hey, Forrest!
Soldier: We can talk, sir.
Tony Stark: Oh, I see. So it's personal?
Soldier :  No, you intimidate them.
Tony Stark: Good God, you're a woman. I honestly... I couldn't have called that. I mean, I'd apologize, but isn't that what we're going for here? I thought of you as a soldier first.
Soldier : I'm an airman.
Tony Stark: Well you have, actually, excellent bone structure, there. I'm kind of having a hard time not looking at you now. Is that weird?  Come on, it's okay, laugh.
Soldier: Sir, I have a question to ask.
Tony Stark: Yes, please.
Soldier: Is it true you went 12 for 12 with last year's Maxim cover models?
Tony Stark: That is an excellent question. Yes and no. March and I had a scheduling conflict, but fortunately, the Christmas cover was twins. Anything else?  You're kidding me with the hand up, right?
Soldier : Is it cool if I take a picture with you?
Tony Stark: Yes. It's very cool.  I don't want to see this on your MySpace page.  Please, no gang signs. No, throw it up. I'm kidding. Yeah, peace. I love peace. I'd be out of a job with peace.
Soldier : Come on. Hurry up. Just click it. Don't change any settings. Just click it.
Tony Stark: What's going on?
Soldier : Contact left!
Tony Stark: What have we got?
Soldier: Jimmy, stay with Stark!
Soldier : Stay down!
Tony Stark: Yeah.
Soldier : Son of a bitch!
Tony Stark: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! Give me a gun!
Soldier : Stay here!
Tony Stark: Whoa!
Voice over: Tony Stark. Visionary. Genius. American patriot. Even from an early age, the son of legendary weapons developer Howard Stark quickly stole the spotlight with his brilliant and unique mind. At age four, he built his first circuit board. At age six, his first engine. And at 17, he graduated summa cum laude from MIT. Then, the passing of a titan. Howard Stark's lifelong friend and ally, Obadiah Stane, steps in to help fill the gap left by the legendary founder, until, at age 21, the prodigal son returns and is anointed the new CEO of Stark Industries. With the keys to the kingdom, Tony ushers in a new era for his father's legacy, creating smarter weapons, advanced robotics, satellite targeting. Today, Tony Stark has changed the face of the weapons industry by ensuring freedom and protecting America and her interests around the globe.
James Rhodes: As liaison to Stark Industries, I've had the unique privilege of serving with a real patriot. He is my friend and he is my great mentor. Ladies and gentlemen, it is my honor to present this year's Apogee Award to Mr. Tony Stark. Tony?
Obadiah Stane: Thank you, Colonel.
James Rhodes: Thanks for the save.
Obadiah Stane: This is beautiful. Thank you. Thank you all very much. This is wonderful. Well, I'm not Tony Stark. But if I were Tony, I would tell you how honored I feel and what a joy it is to receive this very prestigious award. Tony, you know...The best thing about Tony is also the worst thing. He's always working.
Tony Stark: Work it! Come on! We should just stay till the morning.
Woman: You are unbelievable.
Tony Stark: Oh, no! Did they rope you into this?
James Rhodes: Nobody roped me into anything!
Tony Stark: I'm so sorry.
James Rhodes: But they told me that if I presented you with an award, you'd be deeply honored.
Tony Stark: Of course I'd be deeply honored. And it's you, that's great. So, when do we do it?
James Rhodes: It's right here. Here you go.
Tony Stark: There it is. That was easy. I'm so sorry.
James Rhodes: Yeah, it's okay.
Tony Stark: Wow! Would you look at that? That's something else. I don't have any of those floating around. Uh, we're gonna let it ride! Give me a hand, will you? Give me a little something-something.  Okay, you, too.
James Rhodes: I don't blow on a man's dice.
Tony Stark: Come on, honey bear.
James Rhodes: I don't blow on a man's dice.
Tony Stark: There it is. Lieutenant Colonel Rhodes rolls! And...
Dealer: Two craps. Line away.
James Rhodes: That's what happens.
Tony Stark: Worse things have happened. I think we're gonna be fine. Color me up, will ya?
James Rhodes: This is where I exit.
Tony Stark: All right.
James Rhodes: Tomorrow, don't be late.
Tony Stark: Yeah, you can count on it.
James Rhodes: I'm serious!
Tony Stark: I know, I know.  Render unto Caesar, that which is Caesar's. There you go.}
Christine Everhart: Mr. Stark! Excuse me, Mr. Stark! Christine Everhart, Vanity Fair magazine. Can I ask you a couple of questions?
Happy Hogan:  She's cute.
Tony Stark: She's all right?  Hi.
Christine Everhart: Hi.
Tony Stark: Yeah. Okay--
Christine Everhart: It's okay?
Tony Stark: Go.
Christine Everhart: You've been called the da Vinci of our time. What do you say to that?
Tony Stark: Absolutely ridiculous. I don't paint.
Christine Everhart: And what do you say to your other nickname? "The Merchant of Death"?
Tony Stark: That's not bad. Let me guess. Berkeley?
Christine Everhart: Brown, actually.
Tony Stark: Well, Ms. Brown. It's an imperfect world, but it's the only one we've got. I guarantee you, the day weapons are no longer needed to keep the peace, I'll start making bricks and beams for baby hospitals.
Christine Everhart: You rehearse that much?
Tony Stark: Every night in front of the mirror before bedtime.
Christine Everhart: I can see that.
Tony Stark: I'd like to show you first-hand.
Christine Everhart: All I want is a serious answer.
Tony Stark: Okay, here's serious. My old man had a philosophy, "Peace means having a bigger stick than the other guy."
Christine Everhart: That's a great line coming from the guy selling the sticks.
Tony Stark: My father helped defeat the Nazis. He worked on the Manhattan Project. A lot of people, including your professors at Brown, would call that being a hero.
Christine Everhart: And a lot of people would also call that war profiteering.
Tony Stark: Tell me, do you plan to report on the millions we've saved by advancing medical technology or kept from starvation with our intelli-crops? All those breakthroughs, military funding, honey.
Christine Everhart: You ever lose an hour of sleep your whole life?
Tony Stark: I'd be prepared to lose a few with you.
JARVIS: Good morning. It's 7:00 a.m. The weather in Malibu is 72 degrees with scattered clouds. The surf conditions are fair with waist-to-shoulder high lines. High tide will be at 10:52 a.m.
Christine Everhart:  Tony? Hey, Tony?
JARVIS: You are not authorized to access this area.
Christine Everhart: Jesus.
Pepper Potts: That's JARVIS. He runs the house. I've got your clothes here. They've been dry-cleaned and pressed, and there's a car waiting for you outside that will take you anywhere you'd like to go.
Christine Everhart: You must be the famous Pepper Potts.
Pepper Potts: Indeed I am.
Christine Everhart: After all these years, Tony still has you picking up the dry-cleaning.
Pepper Potts: I do anything and everything that Mr. Stark requires, including, occasionally, taking out the trash. Will that be all?
Tony Stark: Give me an exploded view.
JARVIS: The compression in cylinder three appears to be low.
Tony Stark: Log that.
Pepper Potts:  I'm gonna try again, right now.
Tony Stark: Please don't turn down my music.
Pepper Potts: I'll keep you posted.  You are supposed to be halfway around the world right now.
Tony Stark: How'd she take it?
Pepper Potts: Like a champ.
Tony Stark: Why are you trying to hustle me out of here?
Pepper Potts: Your flight was scheduled to leave an hour and a half ago.
Tony Stark: That's funny, I thought with it being my plane and all, that it would just wait for me to get there.
Pepper Potts: Tony, I need to speak to you about a couple things before I get you out of the door.
Tony Stark: I mean, doesn't it kind of defeat the whole purpose of having your own plane if it departs before you arrive?
Pepper Potts: Larry called. He's got another buyer for the Jackson Pollock in the wings. Do you want it? Yes or no.
Tony Stark: Is it a good representation of his spring period?
Pepper Potts: Um, no. The Springs was actually the neighborhood in East Hampton where he lived and worked--
Tony Stark: So?
Pepper Potts: Not "spring" like the season. I think it's a fair example. Um.. I think it's incredibly overpriced.
Tony Stark: I need it. Buy it. Store it.
Pepper Potts: Okay. The MIT commencement speech...
Tony Stark: Is in June. Please, don't harangue me about stuff that's way, way, down...
Pepper Potts: Well, they're haranguing me, so I'm gonna say yes.
Tony Stark: Deflect it and absorb it. Don't transmit it back to me.
Pepper Potts: I need you to sign this before you get on the plane.
Tony Stark: What are you trying to get rid of me for? What, you got plans?
Pepper Potts: As a matter of fact, I do.
Tony Stark: I don't like it when you have plans.
Pepper Potts: I'm allowed to have plans on my birthday.
Tony Stark: It's your birthday?
Pepper Potts: Yes.
Tony Stark: I knew that. Already?
Pepper Potts: Yeah. Isn't that strange? It's the same day as last year.
Tony Stark: Well, get yourself something nice from me.
Pepper Potts: I already did.
Tony Stark: And?
Pepper Potts: Oh, it was very nice.
Tony Stark: Yeah.
Pepper Potts: Very tasteful. Thank you, Mr. Stark.
Tony Stark: You're welcome, Miss Potts... Okay.
Tony Stark: You're good. I thought I lost you back there.
Happy: You did, sir.  I had to cut across Mulholland.
Tony Stark: I got you. I got you.
James Rhodes: What's wrong with you?
Tony Stark: What?
James Rhodes: Three hours.
Tony Stark: I got caught doing a piece for Vanity Fair.
James Rhodes: For three hours. For three hours you got me standing here.
Tony Stark: Waiting on you now. Let's go. Come on. Wheels up! Rock and roll!
Tony Stark: What you reading, platypus?
James Rhodes: Nothing.
Tony Stark: Come on, sour patch.
James Rhodes: I'm not sour.
Tony Stark: Don't be mad.
James Rhodes: I told you, I'm not mad. I'm indifferent, okay?
Tony Stark: I said I was sorry.
Flight Attendant #1: Good morning, Mr. Stark.
James Rhodes: You don't need to apologize to me.
Tony Stark: I told you I was sorry.
James Rhodes: I'm your man.
Tony Stark: Hi. I told him I was sorry, but he...
James Rhodes: I'm just indifferent right now.
Flight Attendant #1: Hot towel?
James Rhodes: You don't respect yourself, so I know you don't respect me.
Tony Stark: I respect you.
James Rhodes: I'm just your babysitter. So, when you need your diaper changed...  Thank you. Let me know and I'll get you a bottle, okay?
Tony Stark: Hey! Heat up the sake, will you? Thanks for reminding me.
James Rhodes: No, I'm not talking... We're not drinking. We're working right now.
Tony Stark: You can't have sashimi without sake.
James Rhodes: You are constitutionally incapable of being responsible.
Tony Stark: It would be irresponsible not to drink. I'm just talking about a nightcap.
Flight Attendant #2: Hot sake?
Tony Stark: Yes, two, please.
James Rhodes: No. Just-- I'm not drinking. I don't want any.
James Rhodes: That's what I'm talking about. When I get up in the morning and I'm putting on my uniform, you know what I recognize? I see in that mirror that every person that's got this uniform on got my back!
Tony Stark: Hey, you know what? I'm not like you. I'm not cut out...
James Rhodes: No, no. You don't have to be like me! But you're more than what you are.
Tony Stark: Can you excuse me if I'm a bit distracted here?
James Rhodes: No! You can't be distracted right now! Listen to me!
Tony Stark: General.
General: Welcome, Mr. Stark. We look forward to your weapons presentation.
Tony Stark: Thanks.
Tony Stark: Is it better to be feared or respected? I say, is it too much to ask for both? With that in mind, I humbly present the crown jewel of Stark Industries' Freedom Line. It's the first missile system to incorporate our proprietary repulsor technology. They say the best weapon is one you never have to fire. I respectfully disagree. I prefer the weapon you only have to fire once. That's how Dad did it. That's how America does it. And it's worked out pretty well so far. Find an excuse to let one of these off the chain, and I personally guarantee you the bad guys won't even want to come out of their caves.  For your consideration, the Jericho.
Tony Stark: I'll be throwing one of these in with every purchase of 500 million or more. To peace!
Obadiah Stane:  Tony.
Tony Stark: Obie, what are you doing up?
Obadiah Stane: I couldn't sleep till I found out how it went. How'd it go?
Tony Stark: It went great. Looks like it's gonna be an early Christmas.
Obadiah Stane: Hey! Way to go, my boy! I'll see you tomorrow, yeah?
Tony Stark: Why aren't you wearing those pajamas I got you?
Obadiah Stane: Good night, Tony.
James Rhodes: Hey, Tony.
Tony Stark: I'm sorry, this is the "fun-vee." The "hum-drum-vee" is back there.
James Rhodes: Nice job.
Tony Stark: See you back at base.
Yinsen: I wouldn't do that if I were you.
Tony Stark: What the hell did you do to me?
Yinsen: What I did? What I did is to save your life. I removed all the shrapnel I could, but there's a lot left, and it's headed into your atrial septum. Here, want to see?  I have a souvenir. Take a look.  I've seen many wounds like that in my village. We call them the walking dead because it takes about a week for the barbs to reach the vital organs.
Tony Stark: What is this?
Yinsen: That is an electromagnet, hooked up to a car battery, and it's keeping the shrapnel from entering your heart. Hmm?  That's right. Smile. We met once, you know, at a technical conference in Bern.
Tony Stark: I don't remember.
Yinsen: No, you wouldn't. If I had been that drunk, I wouldn't have been able to stand, much less give a lecture on integrated circuits.
Tony Stark: Where are we?
Yinsen: Come on, stand up. Stand up! Just do as I do. Come on, put your hands up.
Tony Stark: Those are my guns. How did they get my guns?
Yinsen: Do you understand me? Do as I do.  He says, "Welcome, Tony Stark, the most famous mass murderer "in the history of America."  He is honored.  He wants you to build the missile.  The Jericho missile that you demonstrated.  This one.
Tony Stark: I refuse.
Pepper Potts: Tony!
Yinsen: He wants to know what you think.
Tony Stark: I think you got a lot of my weapons.
Yinsen: He says they have everything you need to build the Jericho missile. He wants you to make the list of materials.  He says for you to start working immediately, and when you're done, he will set you free.
Tony Stark: No, he won't.
Yinsen: No, he won't.
Yinsen:  I'm sure they're looking for you, Stark. But they will never find you in these mountains. Look, what you just saw, that is your legacy, Stark. Your life's work, in the hands of those murderers. Is that how you want to go out? Is this the last act of defiance of the great Tony Stark? Or are you going to do something about it?
Tony Stark: Why should I do anything? They're going to kill me, you, either way. And if they don't, I'll probably be dead in a week.
Yinsen: Well, then, this is a very important week for you, isn't it? Hm?
Tony Stark:  If this is going to be my work station, I want it well-lit. I want these up. I need welding gear. I don't care if it's acetylene or propane. I need a soldering station. I need helmets. I'm gonna need goggles. I would like a smelting cup. I need two sets of precision tools.  How many languages do you speak?
Yinsen: A lot. But apparently, not enough for this place. They speak Arabic, Urdu, Dari, Pashto, Mongolian, Farsi, Russian.
Tony Stark: Who are these people?
Yinsen: They are your loyal customers, sir. They call themselves the Ten Rings.  You know, we might be more productive if you include me in the planning process.
Tony Stark: Uh-huh.  Okay, we don't need this.
Yinsen: What is that?
Tony Stark: That's palladium, 0.15 grams. We need at least 1.6, so why don't you go break down the other 11?
Man #1: What's he doing?
Man #2: Working.
Tony Stark: Careful. Careful, we only get one shot at this.
Yinsen: Relax. I have steady hands. Why do you think you're still alive?
Tony Stark: What do I call you?
Yinsen: My name is Yinsen.
Tony Stark: Yinsen. Nice to meet you.
Yinsen: Nice to meet you, too.  Whoa. That doesn't look like a Jericho missile.
Tony Stark: That's because it's a miniaturized arc reactor. I got a big one powering my factory at home. It should keep the shrapnel out of my heart.
Yinsen: But what could it generate?
Tony Stark: If my math is right, and it always is, three gigajoules per second.
Yinsen: That could run your heart for 50 lifetimes.
Tony Stark: Yeah. Or something big for 15 minutes.
Tony Stark:  This is our ticket out of here.
Yinsen: What is it?
Tony Stark: Flatten them out and look.
Yinsen: Oh, wow. Impressive.
Yinsen: Good. Good roll. Good roll.
Tony Stark: You still haven't told me where you're from.
Yinsen: I'm from a small town called Gulmira. It's actually a nice place.
Tony Stark: Got a family?
Yinsen: Yes, and I will see them when I leave here. And you, Stark?
Tony Stark: No.
Yinsen: No? So you're a man who has everything and nothing.
Man #1: It doesn't look anything like the picture.
Man #2: Maybe it's been modified.
Man #1: The tail is wrong.
Man #2: It's just backwards.
Raza: Relax.  The bow and arrow once was the pinnacle of weapons technology. It allowed the great Genghis Khan to rule from the Pacific to the Ukraine. An empire twice the size of Alexander the Great and four times the size of the Roman Empire. But today, whoever holds the latest Stark weapons rules these lands. And soon, it will be my turn.  Why have you failed me?
Yinsen: We're working. Diligently.
Raza:  I let you live. This is how you repay me?
Yinsen: It's very complex. He's trying very hard.
Raza: On his knees.  You think I'm a fool? I'll get the truth.
Yinsen: We're both working.
Raza: Open your mouth.
Tony Stark: What does he want?
Raza: You think I'm a fool? What's going on? Tell me the truth.
Yinsen: He's building your Jericho. He's building your Jericho.
Tony Stark: What do you want? A delivery date?  I need him. Good assistant.
Raza: You have till tomorrow to assemble my missile.
Yinsen: Okay? Can you move? Okay, say it again.
Tony Stark: 41 steps straight ahead. Then 16 steps, that's from the door, fork right, 33 steps, turn right.
Raza: Where is Stark?
Man: He was here a moment ago.
Raza: Go look for him.
Man: Yinsen! Yinsen! Stark!
Tony Stark: Say something. Say something back to him.
Yinsen: He's speaking Hungarian. I don't...
Tony Stark: Then speak Hungarian.
Yinsen: Okay. I know.
Tony Stark: What do you know?
Tony Stark: How'd that work?
Yinsen: Oh, my goodness. It worked all right.
Tony Stark: That's what I do.
Yinsen: Let me finish this.
Tony Stark: Initialize the power sequence.
Yinsen: Okay.
Tony Stark: Now!
Yinsen: Tell me. Tell me.
Tony Stark: Function 11. Tell me when you see a progress bar. It should be up right now.
Yinsen: Yes.
Tony Stark: Talk to me. Tell me when you see it.
Yinsen: I have it.
Tony Stark: Press Control "l".
Yinsen: "I."
Tony Stark: "I." "Enter."
Yinsen: Got it.
Tony Stark: "l" and "Enter." Come over here and button me up.
Yinsen: Okay. All right.
Tony Stark: Every other hex bolt.
Yinsen: They're coming!
Tony Stark: Nothing pretty, just get it done. Just get it done.
Yinsen: They're coming.
Tony Stark: Make sure the checkpoints are clear before you follow me out, okay?
Yinsen: We need more time. Hey, I'm gonna go buy you some time.
Tony Stark: Stick to the plan! Stick to the plan!  Yinsen! Yinsen!
Tony Stark: Yinsen!
Yinsen: Watch out!  Stark.
Tony Stark: Come on.  We got to go. Move for me, come on. We got a plan. We're gonna stick to it.
Yinsen: This was always the plan, Stark.
Tony Stark: Come on, you're gonna go see your family. Get up.
Yinsen: My family is dead. I'm going to see them now, Stark. It's okay. I want this. I want this.
Tony Stark: Thank you for saving me.
Yinsen: Don't waste it. Don't waste your life.
Tony Stark: My turn.  Not bad.
Tony Stark: Hey!  Hey!
James Rhodes: How was the "fun-vee"? Next time, you ride with me, okay?
James Rhodes: Watch it, coming up here.
Tony Stark: Are you kidding me with this? Get rid of them.  Your eyes are red. A few tears for your long-lost boss?
Pepper Potts: Tears of joy. I hate job hunting.
Tony Stark: Yeah, vacation's over.
Happy: Where to, sir?
Pepper Potts: Take us to the hospital, please, Happy.
Tony Stark: No.
Pepper Potts: No? Tony, you have to go to the hospital.
Tony Stark: No is a complete answer.
Pepper Potts: The doctor has to look at you.
Tony Stark: I don't have to do anything. I've been in captivity for three months. There are two things I want to do. I want an American cheeseburger, and the other...
Pepper Potts: That's enough of that.
Tony Stark: ...is not what you think. I want you to call for a press conference now.
Pepper Potts: Call for a press conference?
Tony Stark: Yeah.
Pepper Potts: What on earth for?
Tony Stark: Hogan, drive. Cheeseburger first.
Obadiah Stane: Look at this! Tony. We were going to meet at the hospital.
Tony Stark: No, I'm fine.
Obadiah Stane: Look at you! You had to have a burger, yeah?
Tony Stark: Well, come on.
Obadiah Stane: You get me one of those?
Tony Stark: There's only one left. I need it.
Obadiah Stane: Hey, look who's here! Yeah!
Agent Coulson: Miss Potts?
Pepper Potts: Yes.
Agent Coulson: Can I speak to you for a moment?
Pepper Potts: I'm not part of the press conference, but it's about to begin right now.
Agent Coulson: I'm not a reporter. I'm Agent Phil Coulson, with the Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division.
Pepper Potts: That's quite a mouthful.
Agent Coulson: I know. We're working on it.
Pepper Potts: You know, we've been approached already by the DOD, the FBI, the CIA...
Agent Coulson: We're a separate division with a more specific focus. We need to debrief Mr. Stark about the circumstances of his escape.
Pepper Potts: I'll put something in the book, shall I?
Agent Coulson: Thank you.
Obadiah Stane: Well, let's get this started, uh...
Tony Stark: Hey, would it be all right if everyone sat down?  Why don't you just sit down? That way you can see me, and I can... A little less formal and...
James Rhodes: What's up with the love-in?
Pepper Potts: Don't look at me. I don't know what he's up to.
Tony Stark: Good to see you.
Obadiah Stane: Good to see you.
Tony Stark: I never got to say goodbye to Dad. I never got to say goodbye to my father. There's questions that I would have asked him. I would have asked him how he felt about what this company did. If he was conflicted, if he ever had doubts. Or maybe he was every inch the man we all remember from the newsreels. I saw young Americans killed by the very weapons I created to defend them and protect them. And I saw that I had become part of a system that is comfortable with zero accountability.
Reporters: Mr. Stark!
Tony Stark: Hey, Ben.
Reporter : What happened over there?
Tony Stark: I had my eyes opened.  I came to realize that I have more to offer this world than just making things that blow up. And that is why, effective immediately, I am shutting down the weapons manufacturing division of Stark International  until such a time as I can decide what the future of the company will be.
Obadiah Stane: I think we're gonna be selling a lot of newspapers.
Tony Stark: What direction it should take, one that I'm comfortable with and is consistent with the highest good for this country, as well.
Obadiah Stane: What we should take away from this is that Tony's back! And he's healthier than ever. We're going to have a little internal discussion and we'll get back to you with the follow-up.  Where is he?
Happy: He's inside.
Obadiah Stane: Well, that..uh... That went well.
Tony Stark: Did I just paint a target on the back of my head?
Obadiah Stane: Your head? What about my head? What do you think the over-under on the stock drop is gonna be tomorrow?
Tony Stark: Uh, optimistically, 40 points.
Obadiah Stane: At minimum.
Tony Stark: Yep.
Obadiah Stane: Tony, we're a weapons manufacturer.
Tony Stark: Obie, I just don't want a body count to be our only legacy.
Obadiah Stane: That's what we do. We're iron mongers. We make weapons.
Tony Stark: It's my name on the side of the building.
Obadiah Stane: And what we do keeps the world from falling into chaos.
Tony Stark: Not based on what I saw. We're not doing a good enough job. We can do better. We're gonna do something else.
Obadiah Stane: Like what? You want us to make baby bottles?
Tony Stark: I think we should take another look into arc reactor technology.
Obadiah Stane: Ah, come on. The arc reactor, that's a publicity stunt! Tony, come on. We built that thing to shut the hippies up.
Tony Stark: It works.
Obadiah Stane: Yeah, as a science project. The arc was never cost effective. We knew that before we built it. Arc reactor technology, that's a dead end, right?
Tony Stark: Maybe.
Obadiah Stane: Huh? Am I right? We haven't had a breakthrough in that in what? Thirty years.
Tony Stark: That's what they say. Could you have a lousier poker face? Just tell me, who told you?
Obadiah Stane: Never mind who told me. Show me.
Tony Stark: It's Rhodey or Pepper.
Obadiah Stane: I want to see it.
Tony Stark: Okay, Rhodey.
Obadiah Stane: Okay.
Tony Stark: Okay? It works.
Obadiah Stane: Listen to me, Tony. We're a team. Do you understand? There's nothing we can't do if we stick together, like your father and I.
Tony Stark: I'm sorry I didn't give you a heads-up, okay? But if I had...
Obadiah Stane: Tony. Tony, no more of this "ready, fire, aim" business. You understand me?
Tony Stark: That was Dad's line.
Obadiah Stane: You gotta let me handle this. We're gonna have to play a whole different kind of ball now. We're going to have to take a lot of heat. I want you to promise me that you're gonna lay low.
Newcaster: Stark Industries! I've got one recommendation! Ready? Ready? Sell, sell, sell! Abandon ship! Does the Hindenburg ring any bells? Let me show you the new Stark Industries business plan! Look, that's a weapons company that doesn't make weapons!
Tony Stark:  Pepper. How big are your hands?
Pepper Potts: What?
Tony Stark: How big are your hands?
Pepper Potts: I don't understand why...
Tony Stark: Get down here. I need you.  Hey. Let's see them. Show me your hands. Let's see them.  Oh, wow. They are small. Very petite, indeed. I just uh.. need your help for a sec.
Pepper Potts: Oh, my God, is that the thing that's keeping you alive?
Tony Stark: It was. It is now an antique. This is what will be keeping me alive for the foreseeable future. I'm swapping it up for an upgraded unit, and I just ran into a little speed bump.
Pepper Potts: Speed bump, what does that mean?
Tony Stark: It's nothing. It's just a little snag. There's an exposed wire under this device. And it's contacting the socket wall and causing a little bit of a short. It's fine.
Pepper Potts: What do you want me to do?
Tony Stark: Put that on the table over there. That is irrelevant.
Pepper Potts: Oh, my God!
Tony Stark: I want you to reach in, and you're just gonna gently lift the wire out.
Pepper Potts: Is it safe?
Tony Stark: Yeah, it should be fine. It's like Operation. You just don't let it touch the socket wall or it goes "beep."
Pepper Potts: What do you mean, "Operation"?
Tony Stark: It's just a game, never mind. Just gently lift the wire.
Pepper Potts: Okay.
Tony Stark: Okay? Great.
Pepper Potts: You know, I don't think that I'm qualified to do this.
Tony Stark: No, you're fine. You're the most capable, qualified, trustworthy person I've ever met. You're gonna do great. Is it too much of a problem to ask? 'Cause I'm...
Pepper Potts: Okay, okay.
Tony Stark: I really need your help here.
Pepper Potts: Okay.  Oh, there's pus!
Tony Stark: It's not pus. It's an inorganic plasmic discharge from the device, not from my body.
Pepper Potts: It smells!
Tony Stark: Yeah, it does. The copper wire. The copper wire, you got it?
Pepper Potts: Okay, I got it! I got it!
Tony Stark: Okay, you got it? Now, don't let it touch  the sides when you're coming out!
Pepper Potts: I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Tony Stark: That's what I was trying to tell you before. Okay, now make sure that when you pull it out, that you don't...  There's a magnet at the end of it! That was it. You just pulled it out.
Pepper Potts: Oh, God!
Tony Stark: Okay, I was not expecting...
Pepper Potts: Okay, what do I do?
Tony Stark: Don't put it back in! Don't put it back in!
Pepper Potts: What's wrong?
Tony Stark: Nothing, I'm just going into cardiac arrest--
Pepper Potts: What? You said it was safe!
Tony Stark: 'cause you yanked it out like a trout... We gotta hurry. Take this. Take this. You gotta switch it out really quick.
Pepper Potts: Okay. Okay. Tony?
Tony Stark: What?
Pepper Potts: It's going to be okay. Okay?
Tony Stark: Is it?
Pepper Potts: It's gonna be okay. I'm gonna make this okay.
Tony Stark: Let's hope. Okay, you're gonna attach that to the base plate. Make s-sure you...  Was that so hard? That was fun, right? Here, I got it. I got it. Here. Nice.
Pepper Potts: Are you okay?
Tony Stark: Yeah, I feel great. You okay?
Pepper Potts: Don't ever, ever, ever, ever ask me to do anything like that ever again.
Tony Stark: I don't have anyone but you. Anyway...
Pepper Potts: What do you want me to do with this?
Tony Stark: That? Destroy it. Incinerate it.
Pepper Potts: You don't want to keep it?
Tony Stark: Pepper, I've been called many things. "Nostalgic" is not one of them.
Pepper Potts: Will that be all, Mr. Stark?
Tony Stark: That will be all, Miss Potts.  Hey, Butterfingers, come here. What's all this stuff doing on top of my desk? That's my phone, that's a picture of me and my dad. Right there. In the garbage. All that stuff.
James Rhodes: The future of air combat. Is it manned or unmanned? I'll tell you, in my experience, no unmanned aerial vehicle will ever trump a pilot's instinct, his insight, that ability to look into a situation beyond the obvious and discern its outcome, or a pilot's judgment.
Tony Stark: Colonel? Why not a pilot without the plane?
James Rhodes: Look who fell out of the sky. Mr. Tony Stark.
Man: Hello, sir.
Tony Stark: Speaking of manned or unmanned, you gotta get him to tell you about the time he guessed wrong at spring break. Just remember that, spring break, 1987. That lovely lady you woke up with.
James Rhodes: Don't do that!
Tony Stark: What was his name?
James Rhodes: Don't do that.
Tony Stark: Was it Ivan?
James Rhodes: Don't do that. They'll believe it.
Tony Stark: Okay.
James Rhodes: Don't do that.
Tony Stark: Okay.
James Rhodes: Don't do that.
Tony Stark: Pleasure meeting you.
James Rhodes: Give us a couple minutes, you guys.  I'm surprised.
Tony Stark: Why?
James Rhodes: I swear, I didn't expect to see you walking around so soon.
Tony Stark: I'm doing a little better than walking.
James Rhodes: Really?
Tony Stark: Yeah. Rhodey, I'm working on something big. I came to talk to you. I want you to be a part of it.
James Rhodes: You're about to make a whole lot of people around here real happy, 'cause that little stunt at the press conference, that was a doozy.
Tony Stark: This is not for the military. I'm not... It's different.
James Rhodes: What? You're a humanitarian now or something?
Tony Stark: I need you to listen to me.
James Rhodes: No. What you need is time to get your mind right. I'm serious.
Tony Stark: Okay.
James Rhodes: It's nice seeing you, Tony.
Tony Stark: Thanks.
Tony Stark: JARVIS, you up?
JARVIS: For you, sir, always.
Tony Stark: I'd like to open a new project file, index as Mark Two.
JARVIS: Shall I store this on the Stark Industries Central Database?
Tony Stark: Actually, I don't know who to trust right now. Till further notice, why don't we just keep everything on my private server?
JARVIS: Working on a secret project, are we, sir?
Tony Stark: I don't want this winding up in the wrong hands. Maybe in mine, it can actually do some good.
Tony Stark: Next. Up. Not in the boot, Dummy. Right here. You got me? Stay put. Nice. You're of no benefit at all. Move down to the toe. I got this. Okay, I'm sorry, am I in your way? Up. Screw it. Don't even move. You are a tragedy.
Tony Stark: Okay, let's do this right. Start mark, half a meter, and back and center. Dummy, look alive. You're on standby for fire safety. You, roll it. Okay. Activate hand controls. We're gonna start off nice and easy. We're gonna see if 10% thrust capacity achieves lift. And three, two, one.
Tony Stark: Up two. All right, set that.
Pepper Potts: I've been buzzing you. Did you hear the intercom?
Tony Stark: Yeah, everything's... What?
Pepper Potts: Obadiah's upstairs.
Tony Stark: Great!
Pepper Potts: What would you like me to tell him?
Tony Stark: Great. I'll be right up.
Pepper Potts: Okay. I thought you said you were done making weapons.
Tony Stark: It is. This is a flight stabilizer. It's completely harmless.  I didn't expect that.  How'd it go? It went that bad, huh?
Obadiah Stane: Just because I brought pizza back from New York doesn't mean it went bad.
Tony Stark: Sure doesn't. Oh, boy.
Obadiah Stane: It would have gone better if you were there.
Tony Stark: Uh-huh. You told me to lay low. That's what I've been doing. I lay low, and you take care of all...
Obadiah Stane: Hey, come on. In public. The press.  This was a board of directors meeting.
Tony Stark: This was a board of directors meeting?
Obadiah Stane: The board is claiming you have post-traumatic stress. They're filing an injunction.
Tony Stark: A what?
Obadiah Stane: They want to lock you out.
Tony Stark: Why, 'cause the stocks dipped 40 points? We knew that was gonna happen.
Pepper Potts: Fifty-six and a half.
Tony Stark: It doesn't matter. We own the controlling interest in the company.
Obadiah Stane: Tony, the board has rights, too. They're making the case that you and your new direction isn't in the company's best interest.
Tony Stark: I'm being responsible! That's a new direction for me, for the company. I mean, me on the company's behalf being responsible for the way that... This is great.
Obadiah Stane: Oh, come on. Tony. Tony.
Tony Stark: I'll be in the shop.
Obadiah Stane: Hey, hey! Hey, Tony. Listen. I'm trying to turn this thing around, but you gotta give me something. Something to pitch them. Let me have the engineers analyze that. You know, draw up some specs.
Tony Stark: No. No, absolutely not.
Obadiah Stane: It'll give me a bone to throw the boys in New York!
Tony Stark: This one stays with me. That's it, Obie. Forget it.
Obadiah Stane: All right, well, this stays with me, then.  Go on, here, you can have a piece. Take two.
Tony Stark: Thank you.
Obadiah Stane: You mind if I come down there and see what you're doing?
Tony Stark: Good night, Obie.
Tony Stark:  Day 11, test 37, configuration 2.0. For lack of a better option, Dummy is still on fire safety. If you douse me again, and I'm not on fire, I'm donating you to a city college. All right, nice and easy. Seriously, just gonna start off with 1% thrust capacity. And three, two, one.  Okay. Please don't follow me around with it, either, 'cause I feel like I'm gonna catch on fire spontaneously. Just stand down! If something happens, then come in. And again, let's bring it up to 2.5. Three, two, one.  Okay, this is where I don't want to be! Not the car, not the car! Table! Could be worse! Could be worse! We're fine! Okay.  No! Uh-uh! Uh-uh! Yeah, I can fly.
Tony Stark: JARVIS, are you there?
JARVIS: At your service, sir.
Tony Stark: Engage heads-up display.
JARVIS: Check.
Tony Stark: Import all preferences from home interface.
JARVIS: Will do, sir.
Tony Stark: All right, what do you say?
JARVIS: I have indeed been uploaded, sir. We're online and ready.
Tony Stark: Can we start the virtual walk-around?
JARVIS: Importing preferences and calibrating virtual environment.
Tony Stark: Do a check on control surfaces
JARVIS: As you wish.  Test complete. Preparing to power down and begin diagnostics.
Tony Stark: Uh, yeah. Tell you what. Do a weather and ATC check. Start listening in on ground control.
JARVIS: Sir, there are still terabytes of calculations needed before an actual flight is...
Tony Stark: JARVIS! Sometimes you got to run before you can walk. Ready? In three, two, one.  Handles like a dream. All right, let's see what this thing can do. What's SR-71's record?
JARVIS: The altitude record for fixed wing flight is 85,000 feet, sir.
Tony Stark: Records are made to be broken! Come on!
JARVIS: Sir, there is a potentially fatal buildup of ice occurring.
Tony Stark: Keep going! Higher!  We iced up, JARVIS! Deploy flaps! JARVIS! Come on, we got to break the ice!
Tony Stark: Kill power.
Tony Stark: Notes. Main transducer feels sluggish at plus 40 altitude. Hull pressurization is problematic. I'm thinking icing is the probable factor.
JARVIS: A very astute observation, sir. Perhaps, if you intend to visit other planets, we should improve the exosystems.
Tony Stark: Connect to the sys. co. Have it reconfigure the shell metals. Use the gold titanium alloy from the seraphim tactical satellite. That should ensure a fuselage integrity while maintaining power-to-weight ratio. Got it?
JARVIS: Yes. Shall I render using proposed specifications?
Tony Stark: Thrill me.
TV Reporter: Tonight's red-hot red carpet is right here at the Disney Concert Hall, where Tony Stark's third annual benefit for the Firefighter's Family Fund has become the place to be for L.A.'s high society.
Tony Stark: JARVIS, we get an invite for that?
JARVIS: I have no record of an invitation, sir.
TV Reporter: ... hasn't been seen in public since his bizarre and highly controversial press conference. Some claim he's suffering from post traumatic stress and has been bedridden for weeks. Whatever the case may be, no one expects an appearance from him tonight.
JARVIS: The render is complete.
Tony Stark: A little ostentatious, don't you think?
JARVIS: What was I thinking? You're usually so discreet.
Tony Stark: Tell you what. Throw a little hot-rod red in there.
JARVIS: Yes, that should help you keep a low profile. The render is complete.
Tony Stark: Hey, I like it. Fabricate it. Paint it.
JARVIS: Commencing automated assembly. Estimated completion time is five hours.
Tony Stark: Don't wait up for me, honey.
Obadiah Stane: Weapons manufacturing is only one small part of what Stark Industries is all about, and our partnership with the fire and rescue community...
Random Woman: Hey, Tony, remember me?
Tony Stark: Sure don't. You look great, Hef.
Obadiah Stane: We're going to have a great quarter.
Tony Stark: What's the world coming to when a guy's got to crash his own party?
Obadiah Stane: Look at you. Hey, what a surprise.
Tony Stark: I'll see you inside.
Obadiah Stane: Hey. Listen, take it slow, all right? I think I got the board right where we want them
Tony Stark: You got it. Just cabin fever. I'll just be a minute. Give me a Scotch. I'm starving.
Agent Coulson: Mr. Stark?
Tony Stark: Yeah?
Agent Coulson: Agent Coulson.
Tony Stark: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. The guy from the..
Agent Coulson: Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division.
Tony Stark: God, you need a new name for that.
Agent Coulson: Yeah, I hear that a lot. Listen, I know this must be a trying time for you, but we need to debrief you. There's still a lot of unanswered questions, and time can be a factor with these things.
Tony Stark: Let's just put something on the books.
Agent Coulson: How about the 24th at 7:00 p.m. at Stark Industries?
Tony Stark: Tell you what. You got it. You're absolutely right. Well, I'm going to go to my assistant, and we'll make a date. You look fantastic! I didn't recognize you.
Pepper Potts: What are you doing here?
Tony Stark: Just avoiding government agents.
Pepper Potts: Are you by yourself?
Tony Stark: Yes. Where'd you get that dress?
Pepper Potts: Oh, it was a birthday present.
Tony Stark: That's great.
Pepper Potts: From you, actually.
Tony Stark: Well, I got great taste.
Pepper Potts: Yes.
Tony Stark: You want to dance?
Pepper Potts: Oh, no.
Tony Stark: All right, come on.
Pepper Potts: Thank you. No.
Tony Stark: Am I making you uncomfortable?
Pepper Potts: No. No. I always forget to wear deodorant and dance with my boss in front of everyone that I work with in a dress with no back.
Tony Stark: You look great and you smell great.
Pepper Potts: Oh, God.
Tony Stark: But I could fire you if that would take the edge off.
Pepper Potts: I actually don't think that you could tie your shoes without me.
Tony Stark: I'd make it a week. Sure.
Pepper Potts: Really? What's your Social Security number?
Tony Stark: Five.
Pepper Potts: Five?
Tony Stark: Right.
Pepper Potts: Right. You're missing just a couple of digits there.
Tony Stark: The other eight? So, I got you for the other eight. How about a little air?
Pepper Potts: Yes, I need some air. That was totally weird.
Tony Stark: Totally harmless.
Pepper Potts: It was totally not harmless, by the way.
Tony Stark: We're dancing. No one's even watching.
Pepper Potts: Everybody who I work with... No, you know why?
Tony Stark: I think you lost objectivity. I think they just... People... We just danced.
Pepper Potts: No, it was not just a dance. You don't understand because you're you. And everybody knows exactly who you are and how you are with girls and all of that, which is completely fine. But, you know, then me, you're my boss, and I'm dancing with you.
Tony Stark: I don't think it was taken that way.
Pepper Potts: Because it makes me look like the one who's trying to...
Tony Stark: I just think you're overstating it.
Pepper Potts: You know, and we're here, and then I'm wearing this ridiculous dress, and then we were dancing like that and... I would like a drink, please.
Tony Stark: Got it, okay.
Pepper Potts: I would like a vodka martini, please.
Tony Stark: Okay.
Pepper Potts: Very dry with olives, a lot of olives. Like, at least three olives.
Tony Stark: Two vodka martinis, extra dry, extra olives, extra fast. Make one of them dirty, will you?
Christine Everhart: Wow. Tony Stark.
Tony Stark: Oh, hey.
Christine Everhart: Fancy seeing you here.
Tony Stark: Carrie.
Christine Everhart: Christine.
Tony Stark: That's right.
Christine Everhart: You have a lot of nerve showing up here tonight. Can I at least get a reaction from you?
Tony Stark: Panic. I would say panic is my reaction.
Christine Everhart: 'Cause I was referring to your company's involvement in this latest atrocity
Tony Stark: Yeah. They just put my name on the invitation. I don't know what to tell you.
Christine Everhart: I actually almost bought it, hook, line and sinker.
Tony Stark: I was out of town for a couple months, in case you didn't hear.
Christine Everhart: Is this what you call accountability? It's a town called Gulmira. Heard of it?
Tony Stark: When were these taken?
Christine Everhart: Yesterday.
Tony Stark: I didn't approve any shipment.
Christine Everhart: Well, your company did.
Tony Stark: Well, I'm not my company.
Obadiah Stane: Please, do you mind?
Tony Stark: Have you seen these pictures? What's going on in Gulmira?
Obadiah Stane: Tony, Tony. You can't afford to be this naive.
Tony Stark: You know what? I was naive before, when they said, "Here's the line. We don't cross it. This is how we do business." If we're double-dealing under the table... Are we?
Reporter: Tony, your picture, please!
Obadiah Stane: Let's take a picture. Come on. Picture time! Tony. Who do you think locked you out? I was the one who filed the injunction against you. It was the only way I could protect you.
Obadiah Stane: No. No.
TV Reporter: The 15-mile hike to the outskirts of Gulmira can only be described as a descent into hell, into a modern-day Heart of Darkness. Simple farmers and herders from peaceful villages have been driven from their homes, displaced from their lands by warlords emboldened by a new-found power. Villagers have been forced to take shelter in whatever crude dwellings they can find in the ruins of other villages, or here in the remnants of an old Soviet smelting plant. Recent violence has been attributed to a group of foreign fighters referred to by locals as the Ten Rings. As you can see, these men are heavily armed and on a mission. A mission that could prove fatal to anyone who stands in their way. With no political will or international pressure, there's very little hope for these refugees. Around me, a woman begging for news on her husband, who was kidnapped by insurgents, either forced to join their militia. Desperate refugees clutch yellowed photographs, holding them up to anyone who will stop. A child's simple question, "Where are my mother and father?" There's very little hope for these refugees, refugees who can only wonder who, if anyone, will help.
Tony Stark: He's all yours.
Captain: What the hell was that? Were we cleared to go in there?
CAOC Analyst #1: No sir, they were using human shields. We never got the green light
Major Allen: Put me through to State. They're going to be all over this.
CAOC Analyst : Get those monitors up!
CAOC Analyst : We got a bogey!
CAOC Analyst : Wasn't Air Force!
Major Allen: We got the CIA on the line?
Captain: I've got Langley on the line. They want to know if it's us.
CAOC Analyst #1: No, it definitely is not us, sir!
CAOC Analyst #2: It wasn't Navy.
CAOC Analyst #3: Wasn't Marines.
Major Allen: I need answers! Can I please get eyes on target?
CAOC Analyst : Negative, negative. Cannot identify.
Major Allen: Get me Colonel Rhodes from weapons development down here now!
Major Allen: We ran an ID check and cross-referenced with all known databases. We have nothing.
James Rhodes: Any high-altitude surveillance in the region?
Captain: We got an AWAC and a Global Hawk in the area.
James Rhodes: So, this thing just appeared out of nowhere? How come it didn't show up on the radar?
CAOC Analyst #1: Got a minimal radar cross-section, sir.
James Rhodes: Is it stealth?
CAOC Analyst #1: No, sir, it's tiny. We think it's an unmanned aerial vehicle.
Major Allen: Colonel, what are we dealing with here?
James Rhodes: Let me make a call.
Major Allen: Sergeant, clear a hole.
Tony Stark: Hello?
James Rhodes: Tony?
Tony Stark: Who's this?
James Rhodes: It's Rhodes.
Tony Stark: Sorry, hello?
James Rhodes: I said it's Rhodes.
Tony Stark: Speak up, please.
James Rhodes: What in the hell is that noise?
Tony Stark: Oh, yeah, I'm driving with the top down.
James Rhodes: Yeah, well, I need your help right now.
Tony Stark: It's funny how that works, huh?
James Rhodes: Yeah. Speaking of funny, we've got a weapons depot that was just blown up a few clicks from where you were being held captive.
Tony Stark: Well, that's a hot spot. Sounds like someone stepped in and did your job for you, huh?
James Rhodes: Why do you sound out of breath, Tony?
Tony Stark: I'm not, I was just jogging in the canyon.
James Rhodes: I thought you were driving.
Tony Stark: Right, I was driving to the canyon, where I'm going to jog.
James Rhodes: You sure you don't have any tech in that area I should know about?
Tony Stark: Nope!
CAOC Analyst : Bogey spotted!
CAOC Analyst : Whiplash, come in hot.
James Rhodes: Okay, good, 'cause I'm staring at one right now, and it's about to be blown to kingdom come.
Tony Stark: That's my exit.
Pilot #1: Ballroom, this is Whiplash One. I've got the bogey in my sights.
James Rhodes: Whiplash One, what is it?
Pilot #1: I've got no idea.
Major Allen: You have radio contact?
Pilot #1: Non responsive, sir.
Major Allen: Then you are clear to engage.
Tony Stark: Hit it.
Pilot #1: That bogey just went supersonic. I got a lock!
JARVIS: Inbound missile.
Tony Stark: Flares!
Pilot #1: Wait a second. Bogey deployed flares!
Tony Stark: Deploy flaps!
Pilot #2: Holy!
CAOC Analyst : That thing just jumped off the radar, sir.
CAOC Analyst #2: The sat visual has been lost.
Pilot #1: No way that's a UAV.
Major Allen: What is it?
Pilot #2: I can't see anything.
Pilot #1: Whatever it was, it just bought the farm. I think bogey's been handled, sir.
James Rhodes: Hello?
Tony Stark: Hi, Rhodey, it's me.
James Rhodes: It's who?
Tony Stark: I'm sorry, it is me. You asked. What you were asking about is me.
James Rhodes: No, see, this isn't a game. You do not send civilian equipment into my active war zone. You understand that?
Tony Stark: This is not a piece of equipment. I'm in it. It's a suit. It's me!
Major Allen: Rhodey, you got anything for me?
Major Allen: Mark your position and return to base.
Pilot #1: Roger that, Ballroom.
Pilot #1: On your belly! It looks like a man! Shake him off! Roll! Roll! I'm hit! I'm hit!
It's confirmed. He has been hit.
Pilot #2: Punch out! Punch out! Whiplash One down.
Whiplash Two, do you see a chute?
Pilot #2: Negative! No chute, no chute!
Pilot #1: My chute's jammed!
Pilot #2: Sir, I've got a visual on the bogey.
Major Allen: Whiplash Two, reengage. If you get a clear shot, you take it.
James Rhodes: Major, we don't even know what we're shooting at. Call off the Raptors.
Major Allen: That thing just took out an F-22 inside a legal no fly zone! Whiplash Two, if you have a clear shot, take it!
JARVIS: You've been reengaged. Execute evasive maneuver.
Tony Stark: Keep going!
Pilot #2: Good chute! Good chute!
James Rhodes: Tony, you still there?
Tony Stark: Hey, thanks.
James Rhodes: Oh, my God, you crazy son of a bitch. You owe me a plane. You know that, right?
Tony Stark: Yeah, well, technically, he hit me. Now are you going to come by and see what I'm working on?
James Rhodes: No, no, no, no, no, no, the less I know, the better. Now, what am I supposed to tell the press?
Tony Stark: Training exercise. Isn't that the usual BS?
James Rhodes: It's not that simple. An unfortunate training exercise involving an F-22 Raptor occurred yesterday. I am pleased to report that the pilot was not injured. As for the unexpected turn of events on the ground in Gulmira, it is still unclear who or what intervened, but I can assure you that the United States government was not involved.
Tony Stark: Hey!
JARVIS: It is a tight fit, sir. Sir, the more you struggle, the more this is going to hurt.
Tony Stark: Be gentle. This is my first time. I designed this to come off, so... Hey. I really should be able to...
JARVIS: Please, try not to move, sir.
Pepper Potts: What's going on here?
Tony Stark: Let's face it. This is not the worst thing you've caught me doing.
Pepper Potts: Are those bullet holes?
Raza: Welcome. Compliments of Tony Stark.
Obadiah Stane: If you'd killed him when you were supposed to, you'd still have a face.
Raza: You paid us trinkets to kill a prince.
Obadiah Stane: Show me the weapon.
Raza: Come. Leave your guards outside.  His escape bore unexpected fruit.
Obadiah Stane: So this is how he did it.
Raza: This is only a first, crude effort. Stark has perfected his design. He has made a masterpiece of death. A man with a dozen of these can rule all of Asia. And you dream of Stark's throne. We have a common enemy. If we are still in business, I will give you these designs... as a gift. And in turn, I hope you'll repay me with a gift of iron soldiers.
Obadiah Stane: Technology.  It's always been your Achilles' heel in this part of the world. Don't worry. It'll only last for 15 minutes. That's the least of your problems.  Crate up the armor and the rest of it. All right, let's finish up here.
Obadiah Stane:  Set up Sector 16 underneath the arc reactor, and I'm going to want this data masked. Recruit our top engineers. I want a prototype right away.
Tony Stark: Hey. You busy? You mind if I send you on an errand? I need you to go to my office. You're going to hack into the mainframe and you're going to retrieve all the recent shipping manifests. This is a lock chip. This'll get you in. It's probably under Executive Files. If not, they put it on a ghost drive, in which case you need to look for the lowest numeric heading.
Pepper Potts: And what do you plan to do with this information if I bring it back here?
Tony Stark: Same drill. They've been dealing under the table, and I'm going to stop them. I'm going to find my weapons and destroy them.
Pepper Potts: Tony, you know that I would help you with anything, but I cannot help you if you're going to start all of this again.
Tony Stark: There is nothing except this. There's no art opening. There is no benefit. There is nothing to sign. There is the next mission and nothing else.
Pepper Potts: Is that so? Well, then, I quit.
Tony Stark: You stood by my side all these years while I reaped the benefits of destruction. And now that I'm trying to protect the people that I put in harm's way, you're going to walk out?
Pepper Potts: You're going to kill yourself, Tony. I'm not going to be a part of it.
Tony Stark: I shouldn't be alive, unless it was for a reason. I'm not crazy, Pepper. I just finally know what I have to do. And I know in my heart that it's right.
Pepper Potts:  You're all I have, too, you know.  Sector 16? What are you up to, Obadiah?
Video Voice Over: You did not tell us that the target you paid us to kill was the great Tony Stark. As you can see, Obadiah Stane...
Pepper Potts: Oh, my God.
Video Voice Over: ... your deception and lies will cost you dearly. The price to kill Tony Stark has just gone up.
Obadiah Stane:  So, what are we going to do about this? I know what you're going through, Pepper. Tony. He always gets the good stuff, doesn't he? I was so happy when he came home. It was like we got him back from the dead. Now I realize, well, Tony never really did come home, did he? He left a part of himself in that cave. Breaks my heart.
Pepper Potts: Well, he's a complicated person. He's been through a lot. I think he'll be all right.
Obadiah Stane: You are a very rare woman. Tony doesn't know how lucky he is.
Pepper Potts: Thank you. Thanks. I'd better get back there.
Obadiah Stane: Is that today's paper?
Pepper Potts: Yes.
Obadiah Stane: Do you mind?
Pepper Potts: Not at all.
Obadiah Stane: Puzzle.
Pepper Potts: Of course.
Obadiah Stane: Take care.
Agent Coulson: Ms. Potts? We had an appointment. Did you forget about our appointment?
Pepper Potts: Nope, right now. Come with me.
Agent Coulson: Right now?
Pepper Potts: We're going to have it right now. Yeah, walk with me.
Agent Coulson: Okay.
Pepper Potts: I'm going to give you the meeting of your life. Your office.
William:  Yeah, we've been working our best to do it. Absolutely, we're... I'm going to have to call you back.  Mr. Stane? Sir, we've explored what you've asked us, and it seems as though there's a little hiccup. Actually...
Obadiah Stane: A hiccup?
William: Yes, to power the suit, sir, the technology actually doesn't exist. So, it's...
Obadiah Stane: Wait, wait, wait. The technology? William, here is the technology. I've asked you to simply make it smaller.
William: Okay, sir, and that's what we're trying to do, but honestly, it's impossible.
Obadiah Stane: Tony Stark was able to build this in a cave! With a box of scraps!
William: Well, I'm sorry. I'm not Tony Stark.
Pepper Potts:  Tony? Tony, are you there? Hello?
Obadiah Stane:  Breathe. Easy, easy. You remember this one, right? It's a shame the government didn't approve it. There's so many applications for causing short-term paralysis. Tony. When I ordered the hit on you, I worried that I was killing the golden goose. But, you see, it was just fate that you survived that.  You had one last golden egg to give. Do you really think that just because you have an idea, it belongs to you? Your father, he helped give us the atomic bomb. Now, what kind of world would it be today if he was as selfish as you? Oh, it's beautiful. Tony, this is your Ninth Symphony. What a masterpiece. Look at that. This is your legacy. A new generation of weapons with this at its heart. Weapons that will help steer the world back on course, put the balance of power in our hands. The right hands. I wish you could've seen my prototype. It's not as... Well, not as conservative as yours. Too bad you had to involve Pepper in this. I would have preferred that she lived.
James Rhodes:  What do you mean, he paid to have Tony killed? Pepper, slow down. Why would Obadiah... Okay, where's Tony now?
Pepper Potts:  I don't know. He's not answering his phone. Please go over there and make sure everything's okay. Thank you, Rhodey. I know a shortcut.
Tony Stark:  Good boy.
James Rhodes: Tony? Tony? Tony? Tony? Tony! Tony! You okay?
Tony Stark: Where's Pepper?
James Rhodes: She's fine. She's with five agents. They're about to arrest Obadiah.
Tony Stark: That's not going to be enough.
Pepper Potts: Section 16. Section 16. There it is. My key's not working. It's not opening the door. Oh, wow! What's that? It's, like, a little device. It's, like, a thing that's going to pick the lock?
Agent Coulson: You might want to take a few steps back.
James Rhodes: That's the coolest thing I've ever seen.
Tony Stark: Not bad, huh? Let's do it.
James Rhodes: You need me to do anything else?
Tony Stark: Keep the skies clear.
James Rhodes: Damn! Next time, baby.
Agent Coulson: Looks like you were right. He was building a suit.
Pepper Potts: I thought it'd be bigger.
Tony Stark: How do you think the Mark One chest piece is going to hold up?
JARVIS: The suit's at 48% power and falling, sir. That chest piece was never designed for sustained flight.
Tony Stark: Keep me posted. Pepper!
Pepper Potts: Tony! Tony, are you okay?
Tony Stark: I'm fine. How are...
Pepper Potts: Obadiah, he's gone insane!
Tony Stark: I know. Listen, you'd better get out of there.
Pepper Potts: He built a suit.
Tony Stark: Get out of there right now!
Obadiah Stane: Where do you think you're going? Your services are no longer required.
Tony Stark: Stane!
Obadiah Stane: I love this suit!
Tony Stark: Put them down!
Obadiah Stane: Collateral damage, Tony.
Tony Stark: Divert power to chest RT.
Jarvis: Power reduced to 19%.
Tony Stark: Lady! No, no, no, no, no, no!
Obadiah Stane: For 30 years, I've been holding you up! I built this company from nothing! Nothing is going to stand in my way. Least of all... you! Impressive. You've upgraded your armor! I've made some upgrades of my own!
JARVIS: Sir, it appears that his suit can fly.
Tony Stark: Duly noted. Take me to maximum altitude.
JARVIS: With only 15% power, the odds of reaching that--
Tony Stark: I know the math! Do it!
Soldier 1: Sir, you're not going to believe this. That thing is back.
Soldier 2: Get me Major Allen. Scramble the jets!
James Rhodes: Not necessary, people. Just a training exercise.
Soldier 1: Yes, sir.
JARVIS: Thirteen percent power, sir.
Tony Stark: Climb!
JARVIS: Eleven percent.
Tony Stark: Keep going!
JARVIS: Seven percent power.
Tony Stark: Just leave it on the screen! Stop telling me!
Obadiah Stane: You had a great idea, Tony, but my suit is more advanced in every way!
Tony Stark: How'd you solve the icing problem?
Obadiah Stane: Icing problem?
Tony Stark: Might want to look into it.
JARVIS: Two percent. We are now running on emergency backup power.
Tony Stark: Woah! Potts!
Pepper Potts: Tony! Oh, my God, are you okay?
Tony Stark: I'm almost out of power. I've got to get out of this thing. I'll be right there.
Obadiah Stane: Nice try!
Tony Stark: Weapons status?
JARVIS: Repulsors offline. Missiles offline.
Tony Stark: Flares!
Obadiah Stane: Very clever, Tony.
Tony Stark: Potts?
Pepper Potts: Tony!
Tony Stark: This isn't working. We're going to have to overload the reactor and blast the roof.
Pepper Potts: Well, how are you going to do that?
Tony Stark: You're going to do it. Go to the central console, open up all the circuits. When I get clear of the roof, I'll let you know. You're going to hit the master bypass button. It's going to fry everything up here.
Pepper Potts: Okay. I'm going in now.
Tony Stark: Make sure you wait till I clear the roof. I'll buy you some time. This looks important!
Obadiah Stane: I never had a taste for this sort of thing, but I must admit, I'm deeply enjoying the suit! You finally outdid yourself, Tony! You'd have made your father proud!
Pepper Potts: It's ready, Tony! Get off the roof! Tony!
Obadiah Stane: How ironic, Tony! Trying to rid the world of weapons, you gave it its best one ever!
Tony Stark: Pepper!
Obadiah Stane: And now I'm going to kill you with it! You ripped out my targeting system!
Tony Stark: Time to hit the button!
Pepper Potts: You told me not to!
Obadiah Stane: Hold still, you little prick!
Tony Stark: Just do it!
Pepper Potts: You'll die!
Tony Stark: Push it!
Pepper Potts: Tony!
James Rhodes:  You've all received the official statement of what occurred at Stark Industries last night. There have been unconfirmed reports that a robotic prototype malfunctioned and caused damage to the arc reactor. Fortunately, a member of Tony Stark's personal security staff...
Tony Stark: "Iron Man." That's kind of catchy. It's got a nice ring to it. I mean, it's not technically accurate. The suit's a gold-titanium alloy, but it's kind of evocative, the imagery, anyway.
Agent Coulson: Here's your alibi.
Tony Stark: Okay?
Agent Coulson: You were on your yacht.
Tony Stark: Yeah.
Agent Coulson: We have port papers that put you in Avalon all night, and sworn statements from 50 of your guests.
Tony Stark: See, I was thinking maybe we should say it was just Pepper and me alone on the island.
Agent Coulson: That's what happened.
Tony Stark: All right.
Agent Coulson: Just read it, word for word.
Tony Stark: There's nothing about Stane here.
Agent Coulson: That's being handled. He's on vacation. Small aircraft have such a poor safety record.
Tony Stark: But what about the whole cover story that it's a bodyguard? He's my... I mean, is that... That's kind of flimsy, don't you think?
Agent Coulson: This isn't my first rodeo, Mr. Stark. Just stick to the official statement, and soon, this will all be behind you. You've got 90 seconds.
Pepper Potts: Agent Coulson? I just wanted to say thank you very much for all of your help.
Agent Coulson: That's what we do. You'll be hearing from us.
Pepper Potts: From the Strategic Homeland...
Agent Coulson: Just call us S.H.I.E.L.D.
Pepper Potts: Right. Let's get this show on the road.
Tony Stark: You know, it's actually not that bad. Even I don't think I'm Iron Man.
Pepper Potts: You're not Iron Man.
Tony Stark: Am so.
Pepper Potts: You're not.
Tony Stark: All right, suit yourself. You know, if I were Iron Man, I'd have this girlfriend who knew my true identity. She'd be a wreck, 'cause she'd always be worrying that I was going to die, yet so proud of the man I'd become. She'd be wildly conflicted, which would only make her more crazy about me. Tell me you never think about that night.
Pepper Potts: What night?
Tony Stark: You know.
Pepper Potts: Are you talking about the night that we danced and went up on the roof, and then you went downstairs to get me a drink, and you left me there, by myself? Is that the night you're talking about? Thought so. Will that be all, Mr. Stark?
Tony Stark: Yes, that will be all, Miss Potts.
James Rhodes: And now, Mr. Stark has prepared a statement. He will not be taking any questions.
Tony Stark: Thank you. Been a while since I was in front of you. I figure I'll stick to the cards this time. There's been speculation that I was involved in the events that occurred on the freeway and the rooftop...
Christine Everhart: I'm sorry, Mr. Stark, but do you honestly expect us to believe that that was a bodyguard in a suit that conveniently appeared, despite the fact that you...
Tony Stark: I know that it's confusing. It is one thing to question the official story, and another thing entirely to make wild accusations, or insinuate that I'm a superhero.
Christine Everhart: I never said you were a superhero.
Tony Stark: Didn't? Well, good, because that would be outlandish and fantastic. I'm just not the hero type. Clearly. With this laundry list of character defects, all the mistakes I've made, largely public.
James Rhodes: Just stick to the cards, man.
Tony Stark: Yeah, okay. Yeah. The truth is... I am Iron Man.
Tony Stark: Jarvis!
JARVIS:  Welcome home, Sir.
Nick Fury: "I am Iron Man." You think you're the only superhero in the world? Mr. Stark, you've become part of a bigger universe. You just don't know it yet.
Tony Stark: Who the hell are you?
Nick Fury:  Nick Fury, Director of S.H.I.E.L.D.
Tony Stark:  Ah.
Nick Fury: I'm here to talk to you about the Avengers Initiative.
Tony Stark: Been a while since I was up here in front of you. Maybe I’ll do us all a favour and just stick to the cards. There’s been some speculation that I was somehow involved in the events that occurred on the freeway and on the rooftop…
Christine Everhart : Sorry, Mr Stark, do you honestly expect us to believe that that was a bodyguard in a suit that convinently appeared despite the fact that you sorely despise bodyguards?
Tony Stark: Yes
MOSCOW
Christine Everhart: And this mysterious bodyguard was somehow equipped with an undisclosed Stark high-tech powered battle…
Tony Stark: I know that it’s confusing. It is one thing to question the official story and another thing entirely to make wild accusations, or insinuate that I’m a superhero.
Switch to view of a TV
Tony Stark: I mean, let’s face it, I’m not the heroric type. A laundry list of character defects, all the mistakes I’ve made, largely public. The truth is… I am Iron Man.
Anton Vanko : Ivan. Vanya. That should be you.
Ivan Vanko : Don’t listen to that crap.
Anton Vanko : I’m sorry. All I can give you is my knowledge.
Pretty much everyone in the crowd: Tony! Tony! Tony! Tony!
Tony Stark: It’s good to be back. You missed me?
Man in crowd: Blow something up!
Tony Stark: I missed you too. Blow something up? I already did that. I’m not saying that the world is enjoying its longest period of uninterrupted peace in years because of me. I’m not saying that from the ashes of captivity, never has a greater phoenix metaphor been personified in human history. I’m not saying that Uncle Sam can kick back on a lawn chair, sipping on an iced tea because I haven’t come across anyone who’s man enough to go toe-to-toe with me on my best day.
Woman in crowd: I love you Tony!
Tony Stark: Please, it’s not about me.  It’s not about you. It’s not even about us. It’s about legacy. It’s about what we choose to leave behind for future generations. And that’s why for the next year and for the first time since 1974, the best and brightest men and women of nations and corporations the world over will pool their resources, share their collective vision, to leave behind a brighter future. It’s not about us. Therefore, what I’m saying, if I’m saying anything, is welcome back to the Stark Expo.  And now, making a special guest appearance from the great beyond to tell you what it’s all about, please welcome my father, Howard.
Howard Stark : Everything is achievable through technology. Better living, robust health, and for the first time in human history, the possibility of world peace. So, from all of us here at Stark Industries, I would like to personally introduce you to the City of the Future. Technology holds infinite possibilities for mankind,  and will one day rid society of all its ills. Soon technology will affect the way you live your life every day. No more tedious work, leaving more time for leisure activities and enjoying the sweet life. The Stark Expo. Welcome.
Reporter: We are coming to you live from the kickoff at the Stark Expo, where Tony Stark has just walked offstage. Don’t worry if you can’t make it down here tonight because this Expo goes on all year long. And I’m gonna be here checking out all the attractions and the pavilions and inventions from all around the world.
Happy Hogan: Make sure you join me…
Tony Stark: All right, it’s a zoo out there, watch out.
Happy Hogan: Open up, let’s go.
Tony Stark: Hey, nice to see you. All right. Thank you. I remember you.
People: Tony, Tony
Tony Stark: Hey, hey.
Woman: Call me.
Happy Hogan: Hey, hey, hey, hey. Come on, come on.
Tony Stark:  Hello. It would be a pleasure.
Happy Hogan: Okay.
Tony Stark:  See you buddy.
Happy Hogan: This is Larry.
Tony Stark: Hey, the oracle of Oracle. What a pleasure. Nice to see you.
Larry King: Call me. Call me.
Happy Hogan: Larry King.
Tony Stark: Larry! Larry. Yes, my people, my people.
Happy Hogan:  Come on, Tony. There we go.
Tony Stark: Very mellow.
Happy Hogan: That wasn’t so bad.
Tony Stark: No, it was perfect.
Happy Hogan: Look what we got here, the new model.
Tony Stark: Hey, does she come with the car?
Happy Hogan: I certainly hope so. Hi.
Tony Stark: Hi. And you are?
Woman: Marshal.
Tony Stark: Irish. I like it.
Marshal: Pleased to meet you Tony.
Tony Stark: I’m on the wheel. Do you mind? Where you from?
Marshal: Bedford.
Tony Stark: What are you doing here?
Marshal: Looking for you.
Tony Stark: Yeah? You found me. What are you up to later?
Marshal: Serving subpoenas.
Tony Stark: Yikes.
Happy Hogan:  He doesn’t like to be handed things.
Tony Stark: Yeah, I have a peeve.
Marshal: I got it. You are hereby ordered to appear before the Senate Armed Services Committee tomorrow morning at 9 am.
Tony Stark: Can I see a badge?
Marshal: You wanna see the badge?
Happy Hogan: He likes the badge.
Marshal:  You still like it?
Tony Stark: Yep.  How far are we from D.C.?
Happy Hogan: D.C.? 250 miles.
WASHINGTON D.C.
Senator Stern: Mr Stark, could we pick up now where we left off? Mr Stark. Please.
Tony Stark:  Yes dear?
Senator Stern: Can I have your attention?
Tony Stark: Absolutely.
Stern: Do you or do you not possess a specialised weapon?
Tony Stark: I do not.
Stern: You do not?
Tony Stark: I do not. Well, it depends on how you define the word weapon.
Stern: The Iron Man weapon.
Tony Stark: My device does not fit that description.
Stern: Well… How would you describe it?
Tony Stark: I would describe it by defining it as what it is, Senator.
Stern: As?
Tony Stark: It’s a high-tech prosthesis. That is… That is… That’s actually the most apt description I can make of it.
Stern: It’s a weapon. It’s a weapon, Mr Stark.
Tony Stark: Please, if your priority was actually the well-being of the American citizen…
Stern: My priority is to get the Iron Man weapon turned over to the people of the United States of America.
Tony Stark: Well, you can forget it. I am Iron Man. The suit and I are one. To turn over the Iron Man suit would be to turn over myself which is tantamount to indentured servitude or prostitution, depending or what state you’re in. You can’t have it.
Stern: Look, I’m no expert…
Tony Stark: In prostitution? Of course not. You’re a senator. Come on.
Stern: I’m no expert in weapons. We have somebody here who is an expert on weapons. I’d now like to call Justin Hammer, our current primary weapons contractor.
Tony Stark: Let the record reflect that I observed Mr Hammer entering the chamber, and I am wondering if and when any actual expert will also be in attendance.
Justin Hammer: Absolutely. I’m no expert. I defer to you, Anthony. You’re the wonder boy. Senator, if I may. I may well not be an expert, but you know who was the expert? Your dad. Howard Stark. Really a father to us all, and to the military-industrial age. Let’s just be clear, he was no flower child. He was a lion. We all know why we’re here. In the last six months, Anthony Stark has created a sword with untold possibilities. And yet, he insists it’s a shield. He asks us to trust him as we cower behind it. I wish I were comforted, Anthony, I really do. I’d love to leave my door unlocked when I leave the house, but this ain’t Canada. You know, we live in a world of grave threats, threats that Mr Stark will not always be able to foresee. Thank you. God bless Iron Man. God bless America.
Stern: That is well said Mr Hammer. The committee would now like to invite Lieutenant Colonel James Rhodes to the chamber.
Tony Stark: Rhodey? What?
Tony Stark: Hey, buddy. I didn’t expect to see you here.
Rhodey: Look, it’s me, I’m here. Deal with it. Let’s move on.
Tony Stark: I just…
Rhodey: Drop it.
Tony Stark: All right, I’ll drop it.
Stern: I have before me a complete report on the Iron Man weapon, complied by Colonel Rhodes. And, Colonel, for the record, can you please read page 57, paragraph four?
Rhodey: You’re requesting that I read specific selections from my report, Senator?
Stern: Yes, sir.
Rhodey: It was my understanding that I was going to be testifying in a much more comprehensive and detailed manner.
Stern: I understand. A lot of things have changed today. So if you could just read…
Rhodey: You do understand that reading a single paragraph out of context does not reflect the summery of my final…
Stern: Just read it, Colonel. I do. Thank you.
Rhodey: Very well. “As he does not operate within any definable branch of government, Iron Man presents a potential threat to the security of both the nation and to her interests.” I did however, go on to summarise that the benefits of Iron Man far outweigh three liabilities and that it would be in our interest…
Stern: That’s enough Colonel
Rhodey: …to fold Mr Stark…
Stern: That’s enough
Rhodey: …into the existing chain of command, Senator.
Tony Stark: I’m not a joiner, but I’ll consider Secretary of Defence, if you ask nice.
Tony Stark: We can amend the hours a little bit.
Stern: I’d like to go on and show, if I may, the imagery that’s connected to your report.
Rhodey: I believe it is somewhat premature to reveal these images to the general public at this time.
Stern: With all due respect, Colonel, I understand. And if you could just narrate those for us, we’d be very grateful. Let’s have the images.
Rhodey: Intelligence suggests that the devices seen in these photos are, in fact, attempts at making manned copies of Mr Stark’s suit. This has been corroborated by our allies and local intelligence on the ground…
Rhodey: … indicating that these suits are quite possibly, at this moment, operational.
Tony Stark: Hold on a second buddy. Let me see something here.  Boy, I’m good. I commandeered your screens. I need them. Time for a little transparency. Now, let’s see what’s really going on.
Stern: What is he doing?
Tony Stark: If you will direct your attention to said screens, I believe that’s North Korea.
Stern: Can you turn that off? Take it off.
Tony Stark: Iran.
Tony Stark: No grave threat here. Is that Justin Hammer? How did Hammer get in the game?
Tony Stark: Justin, you’re on TV. Focus up.
TV Justin: Okay, give me a left twist. Left’s good. Turn to the right. Oh, shit. Oh, shit.
Tony Stark:  Wow. Yeah, I’d say most countries, five, ten years away. Hammer Industries, twenty.
Justin: I’d like to point out that that test pilot survived.
Stern: I think we’re done is the point that he’s making. I don’t think there’s any reason…
Tony Stark: The point is, you’re welcome, I guess
Stern: For what?
Tony Stark: Because I’m your nuclear deterrent. It’s working. We’re safe. America is secure. You want my property? You can’t have it. But I did you a big favour.
Tony Stark: I’ve successfully privatised world peace.
Tony Stark: What more do you want? For now! I tried to play ball with these ass-clowns.
Stern:  you, Mr Stark.  you, buddy. We’re adjourned. We’re adjourned for today.
Tony Stark:  Okay.
Stern: You’ve been a delight.
Tony : My bond is with the people. And I will serve this great nation at the pleasure of myself. If there’s one thing I’ve proven it’s that you can count on me to pleasure myself.
MALIBU, CALIFORNIA
Tony Stark: Wake up, Daddy’s home.
Jarvis : Welcome home, sir. Congratulations on the opening ceremonies. They were such a success, as was your Senate hearing. And may I say how refreshing it is to finally see you in a video with your clothing on, sir.
Tony Stark: You!
Tony Stark: I swear to God I’ll dismantle you. I’ll soak your motherboard. I’ll turn you into a wine rack.
Tony Stark: How many ounce a day of this gobbledegook am I supposed to drink?
Jarvis: We are up to 80 ounces a day to counteract the symptoms, sir.
Tony Stark: Check palladium levels.
Jarvis: Blood toxicity, 24%. It appears that the continued use of the Iron Man suit is accelerating your condition. Another core has been depleted.
Tony Stark:  God, they’re running out quick.
Jarvis: I have run simulations on every known element, and none can serve as a viable replacement for the palladium core.
Jarvis: You are running out of both time and options. Unfortunately, the device that’s keeping you alive is also killing you.
Jarvis: Miss Potts is approaching. I recommend that you inform her…
Tony Stark: Mute.
Pepper: Is this a joke? What are you thinking?
Tony Stark: What?
Pepper: What are you thinking?
Tony Stark: Hey, I’m thinking I’m busy. And you’re angry about something. Do you have the sniffles? I don’t want to get sick.
Pepper: Did you just donate…
Tony Stark: Keep your business.
Pepper: …our entire modern art collection to the…
Tony Stark: Boy Scouts of America.
Pepper: …Boy Scouts of America?
Tony Stark: Yes. It is a worthwhile organisation. I didn’t physically check the crates but, basically, yes. And it’s not “our” collection, it’s my collection. No offence.
Pepper: No, you know what? I think I’m actually entitled to say “our” collection considering the time that I put in, over 10 years, curating that.
Tony Stark: It was a tax write-off. I needed that.
Pepper: You know, there’s only about 8,011 things that I really need to talk to you about.
Tony Stark:  Dummy. Hey, stop spacing out. The Bridgeport’s already machining that part.
Pepper: The Expo is a gigantic waste of time.
Tony Stark: I need you to wear a surgical mask until you’re feeling better. Is that okay?
Pepper: That’s rude.
Tony Stark: There’s nothing more important to me than the Expo. It’s my primary point of concern. I don’t know why you’re…
Pepper: The Expo is your ego gone crazy.
Tony Stark:  Wow. Look at that. That’s modern art. That’s going up.
Pepper: You’ve got to be kidding.
Tony Stark: I’m gonna put this up right now. This is vital.
Pepper: Stark is in complete disarray. You understand that?
Tony Stark: No. Our stocks have never been higher.
Pepper: Yes, from a managerial standpoint.
Tony Stark: You are… Well, if’s messy then let’s double back.
Pepper: Let me give you an example.
Tony Stark: Let’s move onto another subject.
Pepper: No, no, no, no. You are not taking down the Barnett Newman and hanging that up.
Tony Stark: I’m not taking it down. I’m just replacing it with this.
.
Tony Stark: Let’s see what I can get going on here.
Pepper: Okay, fine. My point is, we have already awarded contracts to the wind farm people.
Tony Stark: Yeah. Don’t say “wind farm.” I’m already feeling gassy.
Pepper: And to the plastic plantation tree, which was your idea by the way. Those people are on payroll…
Tony Stark: Everything was my idea.
Pepper: …and you won’t make a decision.
Tony Stark: I don’t care about the liberal agenda any more. It’s boring. Boring. I’m giving you a boring alert.  You do it.
Pepper: I do what?
Tony Stark: Excellent idea. I just figured this out. You run the company.
Pepper: Yeah, I’m trying to run the company.
Tony Stark: Pepper, I need you to run the company. Well, stop trying to do it and do it.
Pepper: You will not give me the information…
Tony Stark: I’m not asking you to try…
Pepper: …in order to…
Tony Stark: I’m asking you to physically do it. I need you to do it.
Pepper: I am trying to do it.
Tony Stark: Pepper, you’re not listening to me!
Pepper: No, you are not listening to me.
Tony Stark: I’m trying to make you CEO. Why won’t you let me?
Pepper: Have you been drinking?
Tony Stark: Chlorophyll. I hereby irrevocably appoint you chairman and CEO of Stark Industries effective immediately. Yeah, done deal. Okay? I’ve actually given this a fair amount of thought, believe it or not.  Doing a bit of headhunting, so to speak, trying to figure out who a worthy successor would be. And then I realised it’s you. It’s always been you. . I thought there’d be a legal issue, but actually I’m capable of appointing my successor. My successor being you.  Congratulations? Take it, just take it.
Pepper: I don’t know what to think.
Tony Stark: Don’t think, drink. There you go.
Pepper: The notary’s here! Can you please come sign the transfer paperwork?
Tony Stark: I’m on happy time.  Sorry.
Happy: What the hell was that?
Tony Stark: It’s called mixed martial arts. It’s been around for three weeks.
Happy: It’s called dirty boxing, there’s nothing new about it
Tony Stark: All right, put them up. Come on.
Pepper: I promise this is the only time I will ask you to sign over your company.
Notary: I need you to initial each box.
Happy:  Lesson one. Never take your eye off…
Tony Stark: That’s it. I’m done. What’s your name, lady?
Notary: Rushman. Natalie Rushman
Tony Stark: Front and centre. Come into the church.
Pepper: No. You’re seriously not gonna ask…
Tony Stark: If it pleases the court, which it does.
Natalie:  It’s no problem.
Pepper:  I’m sorry. He’s very eccentric.
Tony Stark: Can you give her a lesson?
Happy: No problem.
Tony Stark:  Pepper.
Pepper: What?
Tony Stark:  Who is she?
Pepper: She is from legal. And she is potentially a very expensive sexual harassment lawsuit if you keep ogling her like that.
Tony Stark: I need a new assistant, boss.
Pepper: Yes, and I’ve got three excellent potential candidates. They’re lined up and ready to meet you.
Tony Stark: I don’t have time to meet. I need someone now. I feel like it’s her.
Pepper: No, it’s not.
Happy: You ever boxed before?
Natalie: I have, yes.
Happy: What, like, the Tae Bo? Booty Boot Camp? Crunch? Something like that?
Tony Stark: How do I spell your name, Natalie?
Natalie: R-U-S-H-M-A-N.
Pepper: What, are you gonna google her now?
Tony Stark: I thought I was ogling her.  Wow. Very, very impressive individual.
Pepper: You’re so predictable, you know that?
Tony Stark: She’s fluent in French, Italian, Russian, Latin. Who speaks Latin?
Pepper: No one speaks Latin.
Tony Stark: No one speaks Latin
Pepper: It’s a dead language. You can read Latin or you can write Latin, but you can’t speak Latin.
Tony Stark: Did you model in Tokyo? ‘Cause she modelled in Tokyo.
Pepper: Well…
Tony Stark: I need her. She’s got everything that I need.
Happy: Rule number one, never take your eyes off your opponent.
Pepper: Oh, my God! Happy.
Tony Stark: That’s what I’m talking about.
Happy: I just slipped.
Tony Stark: You did?
Happy:  Yeah.
Tony Stark: Looks like a TKO to me.
Natalie: Just… I need your impression.
Tony Stark: You have a quiet reserve. I don’t know, you have an old soul.
Natalie: I meant your fingerprint.
Tony Stark: Right.
Pepper: So, how are we doing?
Tony Stark: Great. Just wrapping up here. Hey. You’re the boss.
Natalie: Will that be all, Mr Stark?
Tony Stark: No.
Pepper: Yes, that will be all, Ms Rushman. Thank you very much.
Tony Stark: I want one.
Pepper: No.
[News report is heard. In French. It’s about the Grand Prix.
Tony, Pepper and Happy are seen leaving a car and walking into a building. Happy is carrying a red suitcase]
Tony Stark: You know, it’s Europe. Whatever happens the next 20 minutes, just go with it.
Pepper: Go with it? Go with what?
Natalie: Mr Stark?
Tony Stark: Hey.
Natalie: Hello. How was your flight?
Tony Stark: It was excellent. Boy, it’s nice to see you.
Natalie: We have one photographer from the ACM, if you don’t mind. Okay?
Pepper: When did this happen?
Tony Stark: What? You made me do it.
Pepper: I made you do what?
Tony Stark: You quit. Smile. Look, right there. Stop acting constipated. Don’t flare your nostrils.
Pepper: You are so predictable.
Tony Stark: That’s the amazing thing.
Natalie: Right this way.
Tony Stark: You look fantastic.
Natalie: Why, thank you very much.
Tony Stark: But that’s unprofessional. What’s on the docket?
Natalie: You have a 9:30 dinner.
Tony Stark: Perfect. I’ll be there at 11:00.
Natalie: Absolutely.
Tony Stark: Is this us?
Natalie: It can be.
Tony Stark: Great. Make it us.
Natalie: Okay.
Pepper: Mr Musk. How are you?
Mr Musk: Hi, Pepper. Congratulations on the promotion.
Pepper: Thank you very much.
Tony Stark: Elon, how’s it going. Those Merlin engines are fantastic.
Mr Musk: Thank you. Yeah, I’ve got an idea for an electric jet.
Tony Stark: You do?
Mr Musk: Yeah.
Tony Stark: Then we’ll make it work.  You want a massage?
Pepper: Oh, God. No. I don’t want a massage.
Tony Stark: I’ll have Natalie make an…
Pepper: I don’t want Natalie to do…
Tony Stark: Don’t want you tense. By the way, I didn’t mean to spring this on you.
Pepper: Thank you very much.
Tony Stark: Green is not your best colour.
Pepper: Oh, please.
Justin: Anthony. Is that you?
Tony Stark:  My least favourite person on Earth.
Justin: Hey, pal.
Tony Stark: Justin Hammer.
Justin: How you doing? You’re not the only rich guy here with a fancy car. You know Christine Everhart from Vanity Fair. You guys know each other?
Christine: Hi. Yes.
Pepper: Yes.
Tony Stark: Yes, roughly.
Pepper: We do.
Justin: BTW, big story. The new CEO of Stark Industries.
Christine: I know, I know.
Justin: Congratulations.
Christine: My editor will kill me if I don’t grab a quote for our Powerful Women issue.
Pepper: Oh.
Christine: Can I?
Pepper: Sure.
Justin: She’s actually doing a big spread on me for Vanity Fair. I thought I’d throw her a bone, you know. Right?
Pepper: Right. Well, she did quite a spread on Tony last year.
Tony Stark: And she wrote a story as well.
Pepper: It was very impressive.
Tony Stark: That was good.
Pepper: It was very well done.
Christine: Thank you.
Pepper: I’m gonna go wash.
Tony Stark: Don’t leave me.
Justin: Hey, buddy. How you doing?
Tony Stark: I’m all right.
Justin: Looking gorgeous.
Tony Stark: Please, this is tough.
Christine: Can I ask you… Is this the first time…
Justin:  Fromage  Say “Brie”.
Christine: …that you guys have seen each other?
Tony Stark: God, that’s so awful.
Christine: Listen, is it the first time you’ve seen each other since the Senate?
Tony Stark: Since he got his contract revoked…
Justin: Actually, it’s on hold.
Tony Stark: …when you were attempting to…That’s not what I heard. What’s the difference between “hold and “cancelled”? The truth?
Christine: Yes, what is it?
Justin: No. The truth is… Why don’t we put that away? The truth is, I’m actually hoping to present something at your Expo.
Tony Stark: Well, if you invent something that works, I’ll make sure I get you a slot.
Natalie: Mr Stark?
Tony Stark: Yes?
Natalie: Your corner table is ready.
Justin: I actually have a slot this year. Yes, I do.
Tony Stark: Hammer needs a slot, Christine.
Justin: We kid, yeah. We kid. We’re kidders.
Tony Stark:  Got any other bad ideas?
Justin:  Tony and I… Tony… I love Tony Stark. Tony loves me. We’re not competitors. Him being out of the picture created tremendous opportunities for Hammer Industries, you know? Everything that Tony and I do…
Tony : Well, what’s the use of having…
Justin: …is a healthy…
Tony Stark: …and owning a race car…
Justin: …competition.
Tony Stark: …if you don’t drive it?
Justin: Is he driving?
Pepper: Natalie. Natalie!
Natalie: Yes, Ms Potts?
Pepper: What do you know about this?
Natalie: This is the first that I have known of it.
Pepper: This, this cannot happen.
Natalie: Absolutely. I understand. How can I help you?
Pepper: Where’s Happy?
Natalie: He’s waiting outside.
Pepper: Okay, get him. I need Happy.
Natalie: Right away.
Justin: Tony’s… You know, he… We’re not competitive. You know what I mean?
Christine: Yeah, yeah, yeah. You know, can you excuse me just one second?
Justin: Just read me what you wrote.
Christine: I will. I will, after.
Justin: Just read it back to me.
Christine: But I have to make one quick phone call.
Justin: Where are you going?
Christine: This is great.
Justin: I’ve got some caviar coming.
Christine: This is great stuff. I’ll be right back.
Someone in background: Look! That’s Stark.
Pepper: Go, go.
Happy: Hang on.
Pepper: Give me the case.
Happy: Here, take it.
Pepper: Where’s the key?
Happy: It’s in my pocket.
Pepper: Car!
Tony Stark: Are you okay?
Happy: Yeah.
Tony Stark: Were you heading from me or him?
Happy: I was trying to scare him.
Tony Stark: ‘Cause I can’t tell!
Pepper: Are you out of your mind?
Tony Stark: Better security.
Pepper: Get in the car right now!
Tony Stark: I was attacked. We need better security.
Happy: Get in the car.
Tony Stark: You’re CEO. Better security measures. God, it’s embarrassing.  First vacation in two years.
Pepper: Oh my God!
Happy: I got him!
Tony Stark: Hit him again. Hit him again. Football.
Happy: I got him.
Pepper: Take the case! Take it!
Tony Stark: Give him the case!
Pepper: Stop banging the car!
Tony Stark: Calm down.
Pepper: God. God.
Tony Stark: Give me the case! Please! Come on!
Ivan:  You… You lose. You lose Stark.
Police officer : On a vérifié ses empreintes et on n’a rien trouvé, même pas son nom.
Tony : Où allons-nous ?
Police Officer : Par là. En fait on ne sait même pas s'il parle. Il a pas dit un mot depuis qu’il est arrivé, pas un son.
Tony : Cinq minutes
Police officer :  . Five minutes. {Door is shut behind Tony.]
Tony Stark: Pretty decent tech. Cycles per second were a little low. You could have doubled up your rotations. You focused the repulsor energy through ionised plasma channels. It’s effective. Not very efficient. But it’s a passable knock-off. I don’t get it. A little fine tuning you could have made a solid pay check. You could have sold it to North Korea, China, Iran, or gone onto the black market. You look like you got friends in low places.
Ivan: You come from a family of thieves and butchers. And now, like all guilty men, you try to rewrite your own history. And you forget all the lives the Stark family has destroyed.
Tony Stark: Speaking of thieves, where did you get this design?
Ivan: My father. Anton Vanko.
Tony Stark: Well, I never heard of him.
Ivan: My father is the reason you’re alive.
Tony Stark: The reason I’m alive is ‘cause you had a shot, you took it, you missed.
Ivan: Did I? If you can make God bleed, the people will cease to believe in him. And there will be blood in the water. And the sharks will come. The truth, all I have to do is sit here and watch as the world will consume you.
Tony Stark: Where will you be watching the world consume me from? That’s right. A prison cell. I’ll send you a bar of soap.
Ivan: Hey, Tony. Before you go, palladium in the chest, painful way to die.
Stern: It’s just unbelievable. It proves that the genie is out of the bottle and this man has no idea what he’s doing. He thinks of the Iron Man weapon as a toy. I was at a hearing where Mr Stark, in fact, was adamant that these suits can’t exist anywhere else, don’t exist anywhere else, never will exist anywhere else, at least for five to ten years, and here we are in Monaco realising, “These suits exist now.”
Tony Stark: Mute. He should be giving me a medal. That’s the truth.
Pepper: What is that?
Tony Stark: This is your in-flight meal.
Pepper: Did you just make that?
Tony Stark: Yeah. Where do you think I’ve been for three hours?
Pepper: Tony, what are you not telling me?
Tony Stark: I don’t want to go home. At all. Let’s cancel my birthday party and… We’re in Europe. Let’s go to Venice, Cipriani. Remember?
Pepper: Oh, yes.
Tony Stark: It’s a great place to be healthy.
Pepper: I don’t think this is the right time. We’re in kind of a mess.
Tony Stark: Yeah, but maybe that’s why it’s the best time. ‘Cause then we can…
Pepper: Well, I think as the CEO I need to show up.
Tony Stark: As CEO, you are entitled to a leave.
Pepper: A leave?
Tony Stark: A company retreat.
Pepper: A retreat? During a time like this?
Tony Stark: Just a ride. Well, I’m just saying, to recharge our batteries and figure it all out.
Pepper: Not everybody runs on batteries Tony.
Justin: Hey. There he is. There he is. What an absolute pleasure. Welcome. Oh goodness gracious. Can we get the handcuffs off my friend here? Forgive me, I’m sorry. I’m such a huge fan of yours. I didn’t want to make a first impression like this. He’s not an animal. Come on. He’s a human being. Thank you.
Henchman : Je te laisse pas avec lui.
Justin : Laisse-nous.
Henchman: Je te laisse pas il est ouf.
Justin: Oui, oui. We’re fine. My name is Justin Hammer. I’d like to do some business with you. Please sit. Dig in. What do we have today Jack?
Jack: We have some salmon carpaccio.
Justin: Salmon carpaccio. Anything you want here, we got it. I like my dessert first. I had this flown in from San Francisco. It’s Italian though. Organic ice cream. I got a sweet tooth. Apparently you do too, for Tony Stark. What I saw you do to Tony Stark on that track, how you stepped up to him in front of God and everybody that was… Wow. You spoke to me with what you did. And I know that you knew that I’d be listening. This is why I couldn’t bear to have you shipped off to God knows where. It would have been such a waste of talent. But if I might make a suggestion, you know, you don’t just go and try to kill the guy. I think, if I may, you go after his legacy. That’s what you kill. You and me, we are a lot alike in a lot of ways. The only difference between you and I is that I have resources. I think, if I may, you need my resources. Someone behind you, a benefactor. I’d like to be that guy.
Ivan : Если меня убьют, не буди меня. Лучше умереть, чем жить в своем мире.
Justin: Okay. Do you speak English? Because I can get a translator. I don’t know. Have you been understanding everything I’m saying?
Ivan: Very good, man.
Justin: Very good, man.
Ivan: Very good, man.
Justin: Hey!
Ivan:  Hey.
Justin: Yes?
Ivan: I want my bird.
Justin: A bird? You want a bird?
Ivan: I want my bird.
Justin: I can get you a bird. I can get you ten birds.
Ivan: I want my bird.
Justin: Well, okay. Nothing’s impossible. I could… Are we talking about… Is this a bird back in Russia?
Pepper:  Yes, but the fundamentals of the company are still very, very strong despite the events in Monaco.
Natalie:  Yes, of course.  The AP wants a quote.
Pepper:  Don’t tell them. Fax them…
Rhodey:  Where is he?
Natalie: He doesn’t want to be disturbed.
Pepper: He’s downstairs.
News reader : But what happened in Monaco?
Pepper: Yes, but….
News reader: But his continuing erratic behaviour may lead many people to ask themselves, “Can this man still protect us?”
Pepper: Iron Man never stopped protecting us. The events in Monaco proved that.
JARVIS: Query complete sir. Anton Vanko was a Soviet physicist who defected to the United States in 1963.However, he was accused of espionage and was deported in 1967. His son, Ivan, who is also a physicist, was convicted of selling Soviet-era weapons grade plutonium to Pakistan, and served 15 years in Kopeisk prison. No further records exist.
Rhodey: Tony, you gotta get upstairs and get on top of this situation right now. Listen. I’ve been on the phone with the National Guard all day, trying to talk them out of rolling tanks up the PCH, knocking down your front door and taking these. They’re gonna take your suits, Tony, okay? They’re sick of the games. You said nobody else would possess this technology for 20 years. Well, guess what? Somebody else had it yesterday. It’s not theoretical anymore. Are you listening to me? Are you okay?
Tony Stark: Let’s go.
Rhodey: Hey, man. Hey, hey! You all right?
Tony Stark: Yeah, I should get to my desk.  See that cigar box?
Rhodey: Yeah.
Tony Stark: It’s palladium.
Rhodey:  Is that supposed to be smoking?
Tony Stark: If you must know, it’s neutron damage. It’s from the reactor wall.
Rhodey: You had this in your body? And how about the high-tech crossword puzzle on your neck?
Tony Stark: Road rash. Thank you.  What are you looking at?
Rhodey: I’m looking at you. You wanna do this whole lone gunslinger act and it’s unnecessary. You don’t have to do this alone.
Tony Stark: You know, I wish I could believe that. I really do. But you’ve gotta trust me. Contrary to popular belief, I know exactly what I’m doing.
QUEENS, NEW YORK.
Justin: This is where we do it. This is my humble abode. You can work in absolute peace. Must be fun to be dead, right? No pressure. Here they are. I’m very excited. They’re combat-ready. I may have done a few miscalculations and rushed the prototype into production. Sue me, I’m enthusiastic. Go ahead, take a look around.  You don’t wanna do that. You’ll be able to access that as soon as we generate some encrypted pass codes. Can we generate some encrypted pass codes? Get some of those encrypted pass codes, Jack. Never mind, I… Wow. Okay. Good stuff.
Ivan : Твой софт говно!
Justin: Sorry?
Ivan: Software shit.
Justin: Well… You’re good. You really blasted in past the firewall there. Let me show you where you’re gonna be working primarily. Go ahead, take a look. Get a good look at that. That’s something, isn’t it? You know, those are really just for show and tell. They’re $125.7 million a pop, so… Wait!  Oh gosh. Jesus Christ. Get somebody up here. That’s where the pilot goes. I’m having a tough time finding volunteers. I’ll take care of that, just leave it.
Ivan: What you want them do?
Justin: Well, long term, I want them to put me in the Pentagon for the next 25 years. I want to make Iron Man look like an antique. I wanna go to that Stark Expo, I wanna take a dump in Tony Stark’s front yard. You know what I’m talking about?
Ivan: I can do that. No problem.
Justin: Yeah? Hey, fabulous! I love it. Hey, this is our guy. Didn’t I tell you? I had a feeling.
Natalie: Do you know which watch you’d like to wear tonight, Mr Stark?
Tony Stark: I’ll give them a look. I should cancel the party.
Natalie: Probably.
Tony Stark: Yeah. ‘Cause it’s…
Natalie: Ill-timed.
Tony Stark: Right, sends the wrong message.
Natalie: Inappropriate.  Is that dirty enough for you?
Tony Stark: Gold face, brown hand. The Jaeger. I’ll give that a look. Bring them over.  I’ll take that. Why don’t you…  I gotta say it. It’s hard to get a read on you. Where are you from?
Natalie: Legal.
Tony Stark: Can I ask you a question, hypothetically? Bit odd. If this was your last birthday party you were ever gonna have, how would you celebrate it?
Natalie: I’d do whatever I wanted to do with whoever I wanted to do it with.
Person: Good evening
Person: Good evening
Rhodey: Yes, sir, I understand. No. No, sir, that will not be necessary. I’ll handle it. Sir, I personally guarantee that within 24 hours, Iron Man will be back on watch.  Hey Pepper.
Pepper: I’m going to get some air.
Rhodey: What’s wrong?
Pepper:  I don’t know what to do.
Rhodey: You gotta be kidding me.  That’s it, I’m making….
Pepper: No, no, no. Don’t call anyone.
Rhodey: Pepper. This is ridiculous. I just stuck my neck out for this guy.
Pepper: I know. I know. I get it. I’m gonna handle it, okay Just let me handle it.
Rhodey: Handle it. Or I’m gonna have to.
Tony Stark:  You know, the question I get asked most often is, “Tony, how do you go to the bathroom in the suit?” Just like that.
Pepper: Does this guy know how to throw a party or what?
Tony Stark: I love you.
Pepper: Unbelievable! Thank you so much. Tony, we all thank you so much for such a wonderful night. And we’re gonna say good night now, and thank you all for coming.
Tony Stark: No, no, no, we can’t … Wait, wait, wait. We didn’t have the cake. We didn’t blow out the candles.
Pepper: You’re out of control, okay? Trust me on this, okay?
Tony Stark: You’re out of control gorgeous.
Pepper: It’s time to go to bed. It’s time.
Tony Stark: Give me another smooch
Pepper: You’re not going to be happy about this.
Tony Stark: Come on, you know you want to.
Pepper: You just peed in the suit.
Tony Stark: I know. It has a filtration system.
Pepper: It’s not sexy.
Tony Stark: You could drink that water.
Pepper: Just send everybody home, okay? It’s time to…
Tony Stark: If you say so.
Pepper: Okay. I’ll take this, you take that
Tony Stark: Pepper Potts. She’s right. The party’s over. Then again, the party was over for me, like, an hour and a half ago. The after-party starts in 15 minutes. And if anybody, Pepper, doesn’t like it, there’s the door.  Yeah!  Hit!  Pull!  I think she wants the Gallagher!
Rhodey:  I’m only gonna say this once. Get out.  You don’t deserve to wear one of these. Shut it down!
Tony Stark:  Goldstein.
Goldstein: Yes, Mr Stark?
Tony Stark: Give me a phat beat to beat my buddy’s ass to.
Rhodey:  I told you to shut it down.
Tony Stark: Now, put that thing back where you found it before someone gets hurt.  Really?  Sorry, pal, but Iron Man doesn’t have a sidekick.
Rhodey:  Sidekick this.  Had enough?
Pepper: Natalie!
Natalie: Miss Potts.
Pepper: Don’t you “Miss Potts” me! I’m on to you. You know what? Ever since you came here…
Happy: Pepper!  Get out of here. Get out of here now.
Tony Stark: You want it? Take it!
Rhodey: Put you hand down.
Tony Stark: You think you got what it takes to wear that suit?
Rhodey: We don’t have to do this, Tony.
Tony Stark: You wanna be the War Machine, take your shot.
Rhodey: Put it down!
Tony Stark: You gonna take a shot?
Rhodey: Put it down!
Tony Stark: No!
Rhodey: Drop it Tony!
Tony Stark: Take it!
EDWARDS AIR FORCE BASE
MOJAVE, CA
Rhodey: Edwards Tower, this is Lieutenant Colonel James Rhodes, inbound from three miles east at 5,000 feet…
Major Allen: Colonel.
Rhodey: Major.
Major Allen: Wow.
Rhodey: Yeah. Let’s take it inside.
Major Allen: Clear the area.
Nick Fury: Sir! I’m gonna have to ask you to exit the doughnut.
Tony Stark:  I told you I don’t wanna join your super-secret boy band.
Fury: No, no, no. See, I remember, you do everything yourself. How’s that working out for you?
Tony Stark: It’s… It’s… It’s… I’m sorry. I don’t wanna get off on the wrong foot. Do I look at the patch or the eye? Honestly I’m a bit hung over. I’m not sure if you’re real of if I’m having…
Fury: I am very real. I’m the realest person you’re ever gonna meet.
Tony Stark: Just my luck. Where’s the staff here?
Fury: That’s not looking so good.
Tony Stark: I’ve been worse.
SHIELD agent: We’ve secured the perimeter but I don’t think we should hold it for too much longer.
Tony Stark:  You’re fired.
Natalie: That’s not up to you.
Fury: Tony, I want you to meet Agent Romanoff.
Tony Stark: Hi.
Natalie/Agent Romanoff: I’m a SHIELD shadow. Once we knew you were ill, I was tasked to you by Director Fury.
Tony Stark: I suggest you apologise.
Fury: You’ve been very busy. You made your girl your CEO, you’re giving away all your stuff. You let your friend fly away with your suit. Now, if I didn’t know better…
Tony Stark: You don’t know better. I didn’t give it to him. He took it.
Fury: Whoa, whoa, whoa. He took it? You’re Iron Man and he just took it? The little brother walked in there, kicked your ass and took your suit?  Is that possible?
Agent Romanoff: Well, according to Mr Stark’s database security guidelines, there are redundancies to prevent unauthorised usage.
Tony Stark: What do you want from me?
Fury: What do we want from you? What do you want from me?  You have become a problem, a problem I have to deal with. Contrary to your belief, you are not the centre of my universe. I have bigger problems than you in the southwest region to deal with.  Hit him.
Tony Stark: Oh, God, are gonna steal my kidney and sell it?  Could you please not do anything awful for five seconds? What did she just do to me?
Fury: What did we just do for you? That’s lithium dioxide. It’s gonna take the edge off. We’re trying to get you back to work.
Tony Stark: Give me a couple of boxes of that. I’ll be right as rain.
Agent Romanoff: It’s not a cure, it just abates the symptoms.
Fury: Doesn’t look like it’s gonna be an easy fix.
Tony Stark: Trust me, I know. I’m good at this stuff. I’ve been looking for a suitable replacement for palladium. I’ve tried every combination, every permutation of every known element.
Fury: Well, I’m here to tell you, you haven’t tried them all.
Justin: Hey, hey, het. Special delivery. Candygram.  I brought you something. Oh yeah.  We got you the bird, pal.
Ivan: This is not my bird.
Justin: What do you mean? That’s the bird. This is the bird. Yeah, pulled a lot of strings to get this bird. This is a great bird.
Jack: It’s a beautiful bird.
Justin: We got this bird all the way from Russia.
Ivan: Hey, man, this is not my bird.
Justin: Well, listen, even if it’s not the bird, I mean, this is a gorgeous bird. I mean, you know, look, don’t get so attached to things. Learn to let go. Wait a minute. Jack, what is that? Is that… That’s not a helmet. What is that?  Ivan… What’s this? Jack. Is that a helmet? It doesn’t look like a helmet to me. How… How are you supposed to get a head in there? Jack, could you put your head in there?
Jack: No.
Justin: Try to put your head in there. Go ahead. Try to put your head in there.  See, Ivan? He can’t put his head in there. That’s… That’s not a helmet. It’s a head. I need to put a guy in there. I need to fit a person in that suit. You understand?
Ivan: Drone better.
Justin: What? Drone better? Why is drone better? Why is drone better?
Ivan: People make problem. Trust me. Drone better.
Justin: Ivan, you know, I like you. I got you the bird. You said, “No problem.” That’s what you said to me. You said, “No problem.” Now I need suits. The government wants suits. Like Iron Man. You understand? That’s what the people want. That’s what’s gonna make them happy.
Ivan: Hey, man. Don’t get too attached to things. Learn to let go.
Justin: These drones better steal the show, Ivan. You understand? Better rock my world, Ivan.
General: Unbelievable. This ought to get the Senate off my ass. It’s functional?
Rhodey: Fully mission-capable.
General: Good. Get Hammer down here to weaponise it.
Rhodey: Sir?
General: Justin Hammer’s making a weapons presentation at the Expo. We’d like this to introduce it.
Rhodey: Sir, I don’t believe that the Expo…
General: Colonel, the world needs to see this fast. We’ve got to make this happen.
Rhodey: Yes, General, but…
General: It’s also an order.
Rhodey: Yes sir.
General: Good work, Colonel. You’ve made your country proud.
Rhodey: Thank you sir.
Fury: That thing in your chest is based on unfinished technology.
Tony Stark: No, it was finished. It has never been particularly effective until I miniaturised it and put it in my…
Fury: No. Howard said the arc reactor was the stepping stone to something greater. He was about to kick off an energy race that was gonna dwarf the arms race. He was on to something big, something so big that it was gonna make the nuclear reactor look like a triple-A battery.
Tony Stark: Just him, or Anton Vanko in on this too?
Fury: Anton Vanko is the other side of that coin. Anton saw it as a way to get rich. When your father found out, he had him deported. When the Russians found out he couldn’t deliver they shipped his ass off to Siberia and he spent the next 20 years in a vodka-fuelled rage. Not quite the environment you want to raise a kid in, the son you had the misfortune of crossing paths with in Monaco.
Tony Stark: You told me I hadn’t tried everything. What do you mean I haven’t tried everything? What haven’t I tried?
Fury: He said that you were the only person with the means and knowledge to finish what he started.
Tony Stark: He said that?
Fury: Are you that guy? Are you? ‘Cause if you are, then you can solve the riddle of your heart.
Tony Stark: I don’t know where you get your information, but he wasn’t my biggest fan.
Fury: What do you remember about your dad?
Tony Stark: He was cold, he was calculating. He never told me he loved me. He never even told me he liked me, so it’s a little tough for me to digest when you’re telling me he said the whole future was riding on me and he’s passing it down. I don’t get that. You’re talking about a guy who’s happiest day was when he shipped me off to boarding school.
Fury: That’s not true.
Tony Stark: Well, then, clearly you knew my dad better than I did.
Fury: As a matter of fact, I did. He was one of the founding members of SHIELD.
Tony Stark: What?
Fury: I got a two o’clock
Tony Stark: Wait, wait, wait, wait. What’s this?
Fury: Okay, you’re good, right?
Tony Stark: No, I’m not good.
Fury: You got this? Right? Right?
Tony Stark: Got what? I don’t even know what I’m supposed to get.
Fury: Natasha will remain a floater at Stark with her cover intact. You remember Agent Coulson, right?
Tony Stark: Yeah.
Fury: And Tony, remember, I got my eye on you.
Natalie/Agent Romanoff/Natasha : We’ve disabled all communications. No contact with the outside world. Good luck.
Tony Stark:  Please. First thing, I need a little bodywork. I’ll put in a little time at the lab. If we could send one of your goon squad down to The Coffee Bean, Cross Creek, for a Starbucks run, or something like that, that’d be nice.
Agent Coulson: I’m not here for that. I’ve been authorised by Director Fury to use any means necessary to keep you on premises. If you attempt to leave or play any games, I will tase you and watch Supernanny while you drool into the carpet. Okay?
Tony Stark: I think I got it, yeah.
Agent Coulson: Enjoy your evening’s entertainment.
Major Allen: Think this is the power source?
Rhodey: Major, this is not a scientific exercise. Let’s just focus on arming it, all right?
Major Allen: Yes, sir.
Justin:  Oh, yes! Oh, yes, yes, yes. Is it my birthday? You got it. What did you do? What did you do? Is this what I think it is?
Rhodey: Yes it is. Hammer, I want to know what you’re gonna do for us.
Justin: What am I going to do for you? Well, the first thing I’m gonna do for you is I’m gonna upgrade your software. And then, second, I think I should…
Rhodey: That’s not what I’m talking about. I’m talking about firepower.
Justin: Well, you’re talking to the right guy.  Claridge Hi-Tec, semi-automatic, 9mm pistol. Too downtown? I agree. M24 shotgun, pump action. Five-round magazine. You know what? You’re not a hunter. What am I talking about? I’m getting rid of it. This is the FN-2000 from Belgium. They do make something better than waffles. It’s beautiful, But I can tell this isn’t disco enough for you, so I’m gonna put it right here. You’re looking at a Milkor 40mm grenade launcher. Tear gas, smoke. Hippie control. You’re tough. Let me tell you something. Size does matter. Don’t let anyone tell you different. This is an M134 7.62 Minigun. Six invidual barrels. The torso taker, powder maker. Our boys in uniform call in Uncle Gazpacho or Puff the Magic Dragon. Okay. These are the Cubans, baby. This is the Cohibas, the Montecristos. This is a kinetic-kill, side-winder vehicle with a secondary cyclotrimethlyenetrinitamine RDX burst. It’s capable of busting the bunker under the bunker you just busted. If it were any smarter, it would write a book. A book that would make Ulysses look like it was written in crayon. It would read it to you. This is my Eiffel Tower. This is my Rachmaninoff’s Third. My Pieta. It’s completely elegant. It’s bafflingly beautiful. And it’s capable of reducing the population of any standing structure to zero. I call it the Ex-Wife. That’s the best I got. Are we gonna do this? Give me something here. You’re like a sphinx. I can’t read you.
Rhodey: I think I’ll take it.
Justin: Which one?
Rhodey: All of it.
Justin: All of it.
Howard : Everything is achievable through technology. Better living, robust heath,  and for the first time in human history, the possibility of world peace. I’m Howard Stark, and everything you’ll need for the future can be found right here. City of the Future? City of Tomorrow? City of… I’m Howard Stark and everything you’ll need in the future can be found right here. So, from all of us at Stark Industries, I would like to personally… Tony, what are you doing back there? What is that?  Put that back. Put it back where you got it from. Where’s your mother? Maria? Go on. Go, go, go, go.
Man : All right, I think we got…
Howard: I’ll… I’ll… I’ll come in and…
Man: Are you waiting on me?
Howard: So, from all of us at Stark Industries, I’d like to personally show you my ass. I’d like to… I can’t… This is… I can’t… We have this, don’t we? This is a ridiculous way… Everything  is achievable through technology.  Tony. You’re too young to understand this right now, so I thought I would put it on film for you. I built this for you. And someday you’ll realise that it represents a whole lot more than just people’s inventions. It represents my life’s work. This is the key to the future. I’m limited by the technology of my time, but one day you’ll figure this out. And when you do, you will change the world. What is and always will be my greatest creation is you. [Tony looks like he’s about to cry as the film ends.
Scene change. He’s driving down a road in car number plate Stark11
He stops to but some strawberries.]
Tony : How much?
Strawberry man: $6. Six.
Tony Stark: I don’t have any dough. Here.
Strawberry man: No, sir, that’s too much.
Tony Stark: No, it’s fine. Take that. It’s fine
Strawberry man: No, señor.
Tony Stark: Take it. Take it. I don’t like people handing me things. If you just drop that there, that’d be great.
Strawberry man: Are you Iron Man?
Tony Stark: Sometimes.
Strawberry man:  We believe in you!
Pepper: It was an illegal seizure of trademark property.
PA: Miss Potts?
Tony Stark: Relax.
PA: Mr Stark…
Tony Stark: Is here.
PA: He refuses…
Tony Stark: I don’t. It’s fine. I’ll just be a second.
Pepper : Listen, it’s our position that Stark has and continues to maintain propriety ownership of the Mark II platform.
News reporter : When Mr Stark announced he was indeed Iron Man, he was making a promise to America.
Pepper: No, the suit belongs to us.
News reporter: We trusted that he would look out for us.
Pepper: Yeah, but you’re not…
News reporter: He obviously did not.
Pepper: Burt…
News reporter: And now we learn that his secretary…
Pepper: Yes, it does.
News reporter: …a woman named Virginia “Pepper” Potts, has been appointed as CEO of Stark Industries. What are her qualifications?
Pepper: No.
News reporter: Miss Potts has done nothing to manage this terrible…
Tony Stark: Mute.
Pepper: No… Burt… Burt… Burt, listen to me. Don’t tell me that we have the best patent lawyers in the country and then not let me pursue this.
Tony Stark:  I’ll get this stuff out of here.
Pepper: Well, then, tell the President to sign an order. We’ll talk about it at the Expo.  Hammer’s giving some presentation tomorrow evening. Will Tony Stark be there?
Tony Stark:  Will I?
Pepper: No, he will not. Bye.
Tony Stark: I would like to be. Got a minute?
Pepper: No.
Tony Stark: Come on, you just got off the phone. You’re fine. 30 seconds.
Pepper: Twenty-nine Twenty-eight.
Tony Stark: I was just driving over here, and I thought I was coming to basically apologise, but I’m not.
Pepper: You didn’t come here to apologise?
Tony Stark: Look, that goes without saying, and I’m working on that. But I haven’t been entirely upfront with you, and I just want to try to make good. Can I move this? This is crazy. It’s like a Ferris wheel, going. I’m trying to get some…
Pepper: No.
Tony Stark: Do you know how short life is? And if I never got to express… And by the way, this is somewhat revelatory to me. And I don’t care… I mean, I care. It would be nice. I’m not expecting you to… Look, here’s what I’m trying to say. I’m just gonna say it.
Pepper: Let me stop you right here, okay? Because if you say “I” one more time, I’m gonna actually hurl something at your head, I think. I am trying to run a company. Do you have any idea what that entails?
Tony Stark: Yes.
Pepper: People are relying on you to be Iron Man and you’ve disappeared, and all I’m doing is putting out your fires and taking the heat of it. I am trying to do the job that you were meant to do. Did you bring me strawberries? Did you know that there’s only one thing on Earth that I’m allergic to?
Tony Stark: Allergic to strawberries. This is progress Pepper. I knew there was a correlation between you and this.
Pepper: I need you…
Tony Stark: I need you too.
Pepper: …to leave now
Tony Stark: That’s what I’m trying to…
Natasha:  Ms Potts?
Pepper: Hi, come on in.
Natasha: Wheels up in 25 minutes.
Pepper: Thank you.
Happy: Anything else, boss?
Tony Stark: I’m good, Hap.
Pepper: No, I’ll be just another minute.
Tony Stark: I lost both the kids in the divorce.  Are you blending in well here, Natalie? Here are Stark Enterprises? Your name is Natalie, isn’t it? I thought you two didn’t get along?
Pepper: No. That’s not so.
Tony Stark: It’s just me you don’t care for. No? Nothing?
Pepper: Actually, while you’re here maybe you and Natalie could discuss the matter of the personal belongings.
Natasha: Absolutely.  I’m surprised you can keep your mouth shut.
Tony Stark: Boy, you’re good. You are mind-blowingly duplicitous. How do you do it? You just tear things… You’re a triple imposter. I’ve never seen anything like you. Is there anything real about you? Do you even speak Latin?
Natasha:
Tony Stark: Which means? Wait. What? What did you just say?
Natasha: It means you can either drive yourself home or I can have you collected.
Tony Stark: You’re good. [Piles things up under desk spinny thing and throws strawberries in the bin. Goes back to the model and looks at it through one eye.
Scene change. Driving it home, fading into workshop]
Tony Stark: Jarvis, could you kindly Vac-U-Form a digital wire frame? I need a manipulatable projection.
Jarvis: 1974 Stark Expo model scan complete, sir.
Tony Stark:  How many buildings are there?
Jarvis: Am I to include the Belgium waffle stands?
Tony Stark: That was rhetorical. Just show me.  What does that look like to you Jarvis? Not unlike an atom. In which case the nucleus would be here. Highlight the unisphere. Lose the footpaths. Get rid of them.
Jarvis: What is it you’re trying to achieve, sir?
Tony Stark: I’m discovering… Correction. I’m rediscovering a new element, I believe. Lose the landscaping, the shrubbery, the trees.  Parking lots, exits, entrances. Structure the protons and the neutrons using the pavilions as a framework. Dad.  Dead for almost 20 years, and still taking me to school.
Jarvis: The proposed element should serve as a viable replacement for palladium.
Tony Stark: Thank Dad.
Jarvis: Unfortunately, it is impossible to synthesise.
Tony Stark: Get ready for a major remodel, fellas. We’re back in hardware mode.
[Smashing walls with sledge hammers, drilling holes in the floor, fiddling with wires, putting together pipes.
Agent Coulson enters]
Agent Coulson: I heard you broke the perimeter.
Tony Stark: Yeah. That was, like, three years ago. Where have you been?
Agent Coulson: I was doing some stuff.
Tony Stark: Yeah, well, me too and it worked. Hey, I’m playing for the home team Coulson, you and all your Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers. Now, are you gonna let me work or break my balls?
Agent Coulson:  What’s this doing here?
Tony Stark: That’s it. Bring that to me.
Agent Coulson: You know what this is?
Tony Stark:  It’s exactly what I need to make this work. Lift the coil. Go, go. Put your knees into it. There you go. And… Drop it. Drop it.  Perfectly level. I’m busy. What do you want?
Agent Coulson: Nothing. Goodbye. I’ve been reassigned. Director Fury wants me in New Mexico.
Tony Stark: Fantastic. Land of Enchantment.
Agent Coulson: So I’m told.
Tony Stark: Secret stuff?
Agent Coulson: Something like that. Good luck.
Tony Stark: Bye. Thanks.
Agent Coulson: We need you.
Tony Stark: Yeah, more than you know.
Agent Coulson: Not that much.
Jarvis: Initialising prismatic accelerator.  Approaching maximum power.
Tony Stark: That was easy.
Jarvis: Congratulations sir. You have created a new element.  Sir, the reactor has accepted the modified core. I will begin running diagnostics.
Justin : Hey Ivan. I got Senator Stern here. Thought we’d swing over and look at some of the drone designs.
Ivan: The drone is not going to be ready.
Justin: Not ready? What do you mean?
Ivan: I can make presentation, not demonstration.
Justin: What the hell is the difference?
Ivan: Presentation. No fly. No shoot.
Justin: Wait, wait, wait. Wait, wait, wait. What can you make them do? I mean, this is a weapons demonstration.
Ivan: I can make salute.
Justin: You can make salute? What do you mean “make salute”? What the hell does that mean Ivan? This is not what we agreed to, okay? You promised me suits and then you promised me drones.
Ivan: Hey, man, everything will be okay.
Justin: This is not what I wanted.
Justin: Hey, there he is. It’s the bird man. Now you like the bird. Is that right? Is that your bird? I’m confused. You said it wasn’t, but now it looks like you’re the best of pals. You love that bird, don’t you? You know what? Take the bird.
Ivan:  Hey!
Justin: Take his pillows too. Both of them. And his shoes. Take his shoes. I took your stuff. How does that make you feel? Do you feel bad? Good. ‘Cause that’s how I feel! We had a contract. I saved your life and you give me suits. That was our deal. And you did not deliver. I don’t know if you’re a genius or a fraud. I don’t know what you are. Something really, really great fell into my lap. And if it hadn’t, I’d be at your mercy tonight. Now I have a piece of Stark tech that I pimped out myself. And now your overpriced paperweights and gonna look like a backdrop to my demonstration. Do you dig what I’m getting at here?
Ivan:  ты слишком много говоришь.
Justin: I don’t know if you know this, but I don’t speak Russian! I’m gonna leave now. I’m gonna go to the Expo. Maybe I’ll even get laid. You see these guys? They’re your babysitters. They are not to be trifled with. When I get back, we’re gonna renegotiate the terms of our agreement. And you’re gonna make good on our arrangement because if you don’t, you’re gonna be exactly what you were when I found you, a dead man. You got that? Maybe you can watch me on TV.
Tony Stark: Dummy, You, can we clean up this mess? You’re killing me. You know I don’t…
Jarvis: Incoming call with a blocked number sir.
Tony Stark: My phone privilege is reinstated. Lovely. Coulson. How’s the Land of Enchantment?
Ivan: Hey, Tony, how you doing? I double cycle.
Tony Stark: You what?
Ivan: You told me double cycle’s more power. Good advice.
Tony Stark: You sound pretty sprightly for a dead guy.
Ivan: You too.
Tony Stark:  Trace him.
Jarvis: Sir.
Ivan: Now, the true history of Stark name will be written.
Tony Stark: Jarvis, where is he?
Jarvis: Accessing the Oracle grid. Eastern Seaboard.
Ivan: What your father did to my family over 40 years, I will do to you in 40 minutes.
Tony Stark: Sounds good. Let’s get together and hash it out.
Jarvis: Tri-State area. Manhattan and outlying boroughs.
Ivan: I hope you’re ready.
Jarvis: Call trace incomplete.
Jarvis: Sir
Tony Stark: You want to run some tests, run them. And assemble the suit while you’re at it. Put it together now.
Jarvis: We are unclear as to the effects.
Tony Stark: I don’t want to hear it Jarvis.  That tastes like coconut. And metal. Oh wow, yeah!
Happy: I’ll keep the car down here, all right?
Pepper: Thank you Happy.
Announcer: …Justin Hammer. His presentation will begin shortly in the main pavilion.
Justin: Yeah. That’s what I’m talking about. Thanks for coming. Ladies and gentlemen, for far too long, this country has had to place its brave men and women in harm’s way, but then the Iron Man arrived, and we thought the days of losing lives were behind us. Sadly, that technology was kept out of reach. That’s not fair. That’s not right. And it’s just too bad.
Pepper: Oh, Lord.
Justin: Regardless, it was an impressive innovation, one that grabbed the headlines the world over. Well, today, my friends, the press is faced with quite a difficult problem. They are about to run out of ink.  Get that out of here. Ladies and gentlemen, today I present to you the new face of the United States military. The Hammer drone.  Army! Navy! Air Force! Marines! Yeah! Yeah! Woo! That’s a hell of a lot better than some cheerleaders, let me tell you. But as revolutionary as this technology is, there will always be a need for man to be present in the theatre of war  Ladies and gentlemen, today I am proud to present to you the very first prototype in the Variable Threat Response Battle Suit and its pilot, Air Force Lieutenant Colonel James Rhodes.
Pepper: What?
Justin: For America and its allies, Hammer Industries is reporting for…
Tony Stark: We got trouble.
Rhodey: Tony, there are civilians present. I’m here on orders. Let’s not do this right now.
Tony Stark: Give them a wave.
Justin: Hey, all right. Yeah.
Tony Stark: All these people are in danger. We gotta get them out of here. You gotta trust me for the next five minutes.
Rhodey: Yeah, I tried that. I got tossed around your house, remember?
Tony Stark: Listen, I think he’s working with Vanko.
Rhodey: Vanko’s alive?
Justin: Yeah.
Tony Stark: What is he?
Justin: What?
Tony Stark: Where’s Vanko?
Justin: Who?
Tony Stark: Tell me.
Justin: What are you doing here man?
Rhodey: Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Tony Stark:  Is that you?
Rhodey: No, I’m not doing that. That’s not me. I can’t move. I’m locked up. I’m locked up!  Get out of here. Go! This whole system’s been compromised.
Tony Stark:  Let’s take it outside.
Rhodey: No, no!
Tony Stark: Jarvis, break in. I need to own him.
Jarvis: Yes sir.
Rhodey: Tony, Tony, I’m locked on. I have target lock.
Tony Stark: On what?
Rhodey: On you.  Tony, on your six!
Justin:  What’s going on? What’s happening?
Technician: The software’s been overridden.
Justin: What? What do you mean it’s been overridden? What does that mean?
Technician: I think he slaved the drones.
Justin: That’s impossible. Call the guards.
Jack: All the phones are down sir.
Justin: Well, then call their… Call their cells.
Jack: Their cell phones are not working either sir.
Technician: He’s locked us out of the mainframe.
Pepper:  Who’s locked you out of the mainframe?
Justin: Please, please, go away. Go away. I’ve got this handled.
Pepper: Have you now?
Justin: Yes, I do. In fact, if your guy hadn’t showed up, this wouldn’t be happening. So, please, now go away. Thank you  Listen, we got to get these bitches out of here. What?
Natasha:  You tell me who’s behind this. Who’s behind this?
Justin: Ivan. Ivan Vanko.
Natasha: Where is he?
Justin: At my facility.
Pepper: I need NYPD, please.
Justin: No, no, no!
Pepper: Command Central.
Justin: No, no, honey. Don’t call the authorities.
Pepper: Okay. Right away. Right away.  Step aside. Step aside.  Tell me everything you know. Go.
Tony Stark: How are we doing Jarvis?
Jarvis: Remote reboot unsuccessful.
Security guard: This way.
Happy: Nobody’s answering the phone. What’s going on?
Natasha: Get in the car. Take me to Hammer Industries.
Happy: I’m not taking you anywhere.
Natasha: Fine. You want me to drive?
Happy: No, I’m driving. Get in the car.
Tony Stark: Nice work kid.
Rhodey: You got multiples coming in on you.
Tony Stark: Let’s get this away from the Expo.
Natasha: Wen we arrive, I need you to watch the perimeter.  I’m gonna enter the facility and take down the target. Watch the road.
Happy: I got it. I got it.
[Tony and Rhodey. Tony sets off one car alarm, the drones set off the rest.
Ivan is still typing inside Hammer Industries]
Rhodey: Listen, listen. A pack just peeled off. They’re headed back to the Expo.
Tony Stark: Got it.
Rhodey: In closing in on you. Ordnance coming in hot Tony. Watch it.
Natasha: Stay in the car.
Happy: I’m not staying in the car.
Natasha: I said, stay in the car.
Happy:  What are you wearing? Look, I’m not letting you go in there alone.
Natasha: You want to help? Keep the car running.
Happy:  Okay.
Hammer security guard: Hey, hey, hey. You can’t come in here.
Second guard: Hold on. Hey!
[Natasha fights the other guards. Some using her SHIELD tech, some just kicking or punching them.
Back at Expo]
Technician: Each set of drone is communicating in its own unique language.
Pepper: Well, choose one and focus on that.
Justin: Have you tried Russian? Why don’t you try Russian?
Announcement: Attention. We have intrusion on Grid W.
Security guard: We got it. We’re on our way.
Happy: I got him! [Sees what Natasha has done
Ivan gets up.
Tony is trying to let the drones away]
Tony Stark: Rhodey, you still locked on?
Rhodey: Yeah.
Tony Stark: Drop your socks and grab your Crocs. We’re about to get wet on this ride.
Rhodey: Wait, wait, wait!
[Tony leads the drones through the globe sculpture. Most explode hitting parts of it.
Natasha kicks open Ivan’s door, a gun in each hand. Happy is behind her. The room is empty.]
Natasha: He’s gone.
Tony Stark: I’m sorry buddy. Had to thin out the herd. What’s your 20?
[Directly above him. Both crash into biodome
Natasha puts her guns on the table and starts typing.]
Happy: What are you doing?
Natasha: I’m rebooting Rhodey’s suit.
Rhodey: Tony.
[Natasha gains access.
Rhodey’s suit shuts down]
Natasha: Reboot complete  You got your best friend back.
Tony Stark: Thank you very much, Agent Romanoff.
Natasha: Well done on the new chest piece. I am reading significant higher output and your vitals all look promising.
Tony Stark: Yes, for the moment, I’m not dying. Thank you.
Pepper:  What do you mean you’re not dying? Did you just say you’re dying?
Tony Stark: Is that you? No, I’m not. Not anymore.
Pepper: What’s going on?
Tony Stark: I was going to tell you. I didn’t want to alarm you.
Pepper: You were gonna tell me? You really were dying?
Tony Stark: You didn’t let me.
Pepper: Why didn’t you tell me that?
Tony Stark: I was gonna make you an omelette and tell you.
Natasha: Hey, hey. Save it for the honeymoon. You got incoming Tony. Looks like the fight’s coming to you.
Tony Stark: Great. Pepper?
Pepper: Are you okay now?
Tony Stark: I am fine. Don’t be mad. I will formally apologise…
Pepper: I am mad!
Tony Stark: …when I’m not fending off a Hammeroid attack.
Pepper: Fine.
Tony Stark: We could have been in Venice.
Pepper: Oh please.
Tony Stark: Rhodes? Snap out of it buddy. I need you. They’re coming. Come on, let’s roll. Get up.
Rhodey:  Oh, man. You can have your suit back.
Tony Stark:  You okay?
Rhodey: Yeah, thanks. Tony, look, I’m sorry, okay?
Tony Stark: Don’t be.
Rhodey: No. I should have trusted you more.
Tony Stark: I’m the one who put you in this position. Forget it.
Rhodey: No. It’s your fault. I just wanted to say I’m sorry.
Tony Stark: Thank you. That’s all I wanted to hear. Partner. They’re coming in hot, any second. What’s the play?
Rhodey: Well, we want to take the high ground, okay? So let’s put the biggest gun up on that ridge.
Tony Stark: Got you. Where do you want to be?
Rhodey: Where are you going?
Tony Stark: What’re you talking about?
Rhodey: I meant me.
Tony Stark: You have a big gun. You are not the big gun.
Rhodey: Tony, don’t be jealous.
Tony Stark: No. It’s subtle all the bells and whistles.
Rhodey: Yeah. It’s called being a badass.
Tony Stark: Fine. All right. You go up to. I’ll draw them in.
Rhodey: Don’t stay down here. This is the worst place to be.
Tony Stark: Okay, you got a spot. Where’s mine?
Rhodey: It’s the kill box, Tony. Okay This is where you go to die.
Tony Stark: See that?
Rhodey: Yeah, yeah. Nice.
Tony Stark: Rhodey? Get down.
Rhodey: Wow. I think you should lead with that next time.
Tony Stark: Yeah. Sorry boss. I can only use it one. It’s a one-off.
Justin: I told you that five minutes ago.
Pepper:  That’s your guy here.
Justin: Excuse me?
Police officer: You’re being placed under arrest.
Justin: Are you kidding me?
Police officer: Hands behind your back sir.
Justin: I’m trying to help here. I get it. I see what you’re doing. You’re trying to pin this on me, huh? That’s good. That’s good. You’re starting to think like a CEO, taking out the competition. I like that. You think you’re making a problem for me?  I’m gonna make a problem for you. I’m gonna be seeing you again real soon.
Pepper:  When they get here, I think you should station them at the south, east and both west exits.
Police officer: We shut down the 7 train in and out of Willets Point already.
Pepper: Well, have city buses there to ferry people to operating lines.
Police officer: Yeah. Are you coming with us?
Pepper: No, I’m gonna stay until to park is clear.
Police officer: Okay.
Natasha: Head up. You got one more drone incoming. This one looks different.  The repulsor signature is significantly higher.
Ivan:  Good to be back.
Rhodey: This ain’t gonna be good.  I got something special for this guy. I’m gonna bust his bunker with the Ex-Wife.
Tony Stark: With the what?  Hammer tech?
Rhodey: Yeah.
Tony Stark: I got this.  Rhodes. I got an idea. You want to be a hero?
Rhodey: What?
Tony Stark: I could really use a sidekick. Put your hand up.
Rhodey: This is your idea?
Tony Stark: Yep.
Rhodey: I’m ready. I’m ready. Go, go, go!
Tony Stark: Take it!
Ivan: You lose.
Rhodey: All these drones are rigged to blow. We gotta get out of here man.
Tony Stark: Pepper?
Pepper: Oh my God. I can’t take this anymore.
Tony Stark: You can’t?
Pepper: I can’t take this.
Tony Stark: Look at me.
Pepper: My body, literally, cannot handle the stress. I never know if you’re gonna kill yourself or wreak the whole company.
Tony Stark: I think I did okay.
Pepper: I quit. I’m resigning. That’s it.
Tony Stark: What did you just say? You’re done? That’s surprising. No, it’s not surprising. I get it. You don’t have to make excuses.
Pepper: I’m… I’m… I’m not making any excuses.
Tony Stark: You actually were just making excuses. But you don’t have to.
Pepper: No, I wasn’t making an excuse. I’m actually very justified.
Tony Stark: Listen. Hey, hey. You deserve better.
Pepper: Well…
Tony Stark: You’ve taken such good care of me. I’ve been in a tough spot, but you got me through it, so… Right?
Pepper: Thank you.
Tony Stark: Yeah.
Pepper: Thank you for understanding.
Tony Stark: Yeah, yeah. Let’s talk clean-up.
Pepper: I’ll handle the transition. It’ll be smooth.
Tony Stark: Okay. What about the press? Because you only had the job for a week. That’s gonna seem…
Pepper: Well, with you it’s like dog years.
Tony Stark: I know.
Pepper: I mean, it’s like the Presidency.
Tony Stark: Weird.
Pepper: No, it’s not weird.
Tony Stark: It’s okay, right?
Pepper: Yeah.
Tony Stark: Run that by me again.
Rhodey: I think it was weird.  You guys look like two seals fighting over a grape.
Pepper: I had just quit, actually.
Tony Stark: Yeah, so we’re not…
Rhodey: You don’t have to do that. I heard the whole thing.
Tony Stark: You should get lost.
Rhodey: I was here first. Get a roof.
Tony Stark: I thought you were out of one-liners.
Rhodey: That’s the last one.
Tony Stark: You kicked ass back there, by the way.
Rhodey: Thank you. You too. Listen, my car got taken out in the explosion, so I’m gonna have to hang on to your suit for a minute, okay?
Tony Stark: Not okay. Not okay with that.
Rhodey: It wasn’t a question.
Tony Stark: How are you gonna resign if I don’t accept?
[Scene change. Some kind of building. Tony is inside sitting at a table. SHIELD logo is there.
Picks up file. AVENGERS INITIATIVE PREMLIMIARY REPORT
Nick Fury enters while looking and stops him opening it]
Fury: I don’t think I want you looking at that. I’m not sure it pertains to you anymore. Now this on the other hand, is Agent Romanoff’s assessment of you. Read it.
Tony Stark: “Personality overview. Mr Stark displays compulsive behaviour.” In my own defence, that was last week. “Prone to self-destructive tendencies.” I was dying. I mean, please. Aren’t we all? “Textbook narcissism”? Agreed. Okay, here it is. “Recruitment assessment for Avenger Initiative. Iron Man? Yes.” I gotta think about it.
Fury: Read on.
Tony Stark: “Tony Stark not… Not recommended”? That doesn’t make any sense. How can you approve me but not approve me? I got a new ticker. I’m trying to do right by Pepper. I’m in a stable-ish relationship.
Fury: Which leads us to believe at this juncture we’d only like to use you as a consultant.
Tony Stark:  You can’t afford me.  Then again, I will waive my customary retainer in exchange for a small favour. Rhodey and I are being honoured in Washington and we need a presenter.
Fury: I’ll see what I can do.
Stern: It is my honour to be here today to present these distinguished awards to Lieutenant Colonel James Rhodes and Mr Tony Stark, who is, of course, a national treasure.  Thank you Lieutenant Colonel, for such and exceptionally distinguished performance. You deserve this.
Rhodey: Thank you sir.
Stern: Mr Stark. Thank you for such as exceptionally distinguished performance. You deserve this.  Oh, sorry. Funny how annoying a little prick can be, isn’t it? Let’s get a photo.
CUT TO: EXT. THRONE ROOM, SPACE - NIGHT
THE OTHER: The tesseract has awakened. It is on a little world. A human world. They would wield its power...
Loki:
THE OTHER: But our ally knows its workings as they never will. He is ready to lead. And our force, our Chitauri, will follow.
THE OTHER: The world will be his. The universe yours. And the humans, what can they do but burn?
NICK FURY: How bad is it?
AGENT PHIL COULSON: That's the problem sir. We don't know.
COULSON: Dr. Selvig read an energy surge from the Tesseract four hours ago.
FURY: NASA didn't authorise Selvig to test phase.
COULSON: He wasn't testing it, he wasn't even in the room. Spontaneous advancement.
AGENT MARIA HILL: It just turned itself on?
FURY: What are the energy levels
COULSON: Climbing. When Selvig couldn't shut it down, we ordered evac.
FURY: How long to get everyone out?
COULSON: Campus should be clear in the next half hour.
FURY: Do better.
HILL: Sir, evacuation may be futile.
FURY: We should tell them to go back to sleep?
HILL: If we can't control the Tesseract's energy, there may not be a minimum safe distance.
FURY: I need you to make sure Phase 2 prototypes are shipped out.
HILL: Sir, is that really a priority right now?
FURY: Until such a time as the world ends, we will act as though it intends to spin on. Clear out the tech below. Every piece of Phase 2 on a truck and gone.
HILL: Yes sir.  With me.
FURY: Talk to me doctor.
Dr. ERIK SELVIG: Director.
FURY: Is there anything we know for certain?
SELVIG: The Tesseract is misbehaving.
FURY: Is that supposed to be funny?
SELVIG: No, it's not funny at all. The Tesseract is not only active, she's... misbehaving.
FURY: How soon until you pull the plug?
SELVIG: She's an energy source. If we turn off the power, she turns it back on. If she reaches peak level...
FURY: We've prepared for this doctor. Harnessing energy from space.
SELVIG: We don't have the harness. Our calculations are far from complete. Now she's throwing off interference, radiation. Nothing harmful, low levels of gamma radiation.
FURY: That can be harmful. Where's Barton?
SELVIG: The Hawk? Up in his nest, as usual
FURY: Agent Barton, report.
FURY: I gave you this detail so you could keep a close eye on things.
CLINT BARTON: Well, I see better from a distance.
FURY: Are you seeing anything that might set this thing off?
NASA SCIENTIST:  Doctor, it's spiking again.
CLINT: No one's come or gone. It's oven is clean. No contacts, no I.M.s. If there was any tampering, sir, it wasn't at this end.
FURY: At this end?
CLINT: Yeah, the cube is a doorway to the other end of space, right? The doors open from both sides.
FURY: Sir please put down the spear.
LOKI: You have heart.
LOKI: Please don't. I still need that.
FURY:  This doesn't have to get any messier.
LOKI: Of course it does. I've come too far for anything else. I am Loki of Asgard, and I am burdened with glorious purpose.
SELVIG: Loki? Brother of Thor?
FURY: We have no quarrel with your people.
LOKI: An ant had no quarrel with a boot.
FURY: You planning to step on us?
LOKI: I come with glad tidings, of a world made free.
FURY: Free from what?
LOKI: Freedom. Freedom is life's great lie. Once you accept that, in your heart...
LOKI: You will know peace.
FURY: Yeah, you say peace, I kind of think you mean the other thing.
CLINT: Sir, Director Fury is stalling. This place is about to blow. Drop a hundred feet of rock on us. He means to bury us.
FURY: Like the Pharaohs of old.
SELVIG: He's right. The portal is collapsing in on itself. You got maybe two minutes before this goes critical.
LOKI: Well then.
CLINT:  Need these vehicles.
HILL: Who's that?
CLINT: He didn't tell me.
FURY:  Hill, do you copy?
FURY: Barton is...
FURY:  He's got the Tesseract! Track it down!
COULSON: No! Leave it!
COULSON:  You're clear, sir! You need to go!
COULSON:  Director? Director Fury, do you copy?
FURY: The tesseract is with the hostile force. I have men down. Hill?
HILL:  A lot of men still under, don't know how many survivors.
FURY: Sound the general call. I want every living soul not working rescue looking for that briefcase.
HILL:  Roger that.
FURY: Coulson, get back to base. This is a Level Seven. As of right now, we are at war.
COULSON: What do we do?
GENERAL LUCHKOV:  This is not how I wanted the evening to go.
NATASHA ROMANOFF: I know how you wanted this evening to go. Believe me, this is better.
LUCHKOV: I'd like to know why they sent you to carry out a carrier, a stained glass and other random items.
NATASHA: I thought General Solohob was in charge of the export business.
LUCHKOV: Solohob? Your reputation is quite a progression. The famous Black Widow. Nothing but a pretty face.
NATASHA: You really think I'm pretty?
LUCHKOV: We do not need the Lermontov to transfer the tanks. Tell him, well...  You may have to write it down.
WEASELLY THUG: Ya?  It's for you.
LUCHKOV: Who the hell is...
COULSON: You're at 114 Solenski Plaza, 3rd floor. We have an F22 exactly 8 miles out. Put the woman on the phone or I will blow up the block before you can make the lobby.
COULSON: We need you to come in.
NATASHA: Are you kidding? I'm working!
COULSON: This takes precedence.
NATASHA: I'm in the middle of an interrogation and this moron is giving me everything.
LUCHKOV:  I don't give everything.
NATASHA:  Look, you can't pull me out of this right now.
COULSON: Natasha. Barton's been compromised.
NATASHA:  Let me put you on hold.
NATASHA: Where's Barton now?
COULSON: We don't know.
NATASHA: But he's alive.
COULSON: We think so. I'll brief you on everything when you get back. But first, we need you to talk to the big guy.
NATASHA: Coulson, you know that Stark only trusts me about as far as he can throw me.
COULSON: No, I've got Stark. You get the big guy.
NATASHA:  Bozhe moi.
ATTENDING WOMAN: What are you doing here?! Get out! You shouldn't be here.
LITTLE GIRL: I have to see the doctor. It's my father.
BRUCE: Calm down. What's wrong?
LITTLE GIRL: My father...
BRUCE: Is he like them?
LITTLE GIRL:  Please.
BRUCE: Should have gotten paid up front, Banner.
NATASHA:  You know, for a man who's supposed to be avoiding stress, you picked a hell of a place to settle.
BRUCE: Avoiding stress isn't the secret.
NATASHA: Then, what is it? Yoga?
BANNER: You brought me to the edge of the city, smart. I uh... assume the whole place is surrounded?
NATASHA: Just you and me.
BRUCE: And your actress buddy, is she a spy too? Do they start that young?
NATASHA: I did.
BRUCE: Who are you?
NATASHA: Natasha Romanoff.
BRUCE: Are you here to kill me, Miss Romanoff? Because that's not gonna work out for everyone.
NATASHA: No. No. Of course not. I'm here on behalf of SHIELD.
BRUCE: SHIELD. How did they find me?
NATASHA: We never lost you, doctor. We've kept our distance, even helped keep some other interested parties off your scent.
BRUCE: Why?
NATASHA: Nick Fury seems to trust you. But now I need you to come in.
BRUCE: What if I said no?
NATASHA: I'll persuade you.
BRUCE: And what if the... other guy says no?
NATASHA: You've been more than a year without an incident. I don't think you wanna break that streak.
BRUCE:  I don't always get what I want.
NATASHA: Doctor, we're facing a potential global catastrophe.
BRUCE: Well, those I actively try to avoid.
NATASHA: This is the Tesseract. It has the potential energy to wipe out the planet.
BRUCE: What does Fury want me to do? Swallow it?
NATASHA: Well, he wants you to find it. It's been taken. It emits a gamma signature that's too weak for us to trace. There's no one that knows gamma radiation like you do. If there was, that's where I'd be.
BRUCE: So Fury isn't after the monster?
NATASHA: Not that he's told me.
BRUCE: And he tells you everything?
NATASHA: Talk to Fury, he needs you on this.
BRUCE: He needs me in a cage?
NATASHA: No one's gonna put you in a...
BRUCE: STOP LYING TO ME!
BRUCE: I'm sorry, that was mean. I just wanted to see what you'd do. Why don't we do this the easy way, where you don't use that, and the other guy doesn't make a mess? Okay? Natasha...
NATASHA:  Stand down. We're good here.
BRUCE:  Just you and me?
COUNCIL MEMBER 1: This is out of line, Director. You're dealing with forces you can't control.
FURY: You ever been in a war, Councilman? In a firefight? Did you feel an overabundance of control?
COUNCIL MEMBER 1: You saying that this Asgard has declared war on our planet?
FURY: Not Asgard, Loki.
COUNCIL MEMBER 2: He can't be working alone. What about the other one? His brother.
FURY: Our intelligence says, Thor is not a hostile. But he's worlds away, we can't depend on him to help. It's up to us.
COUNCIL MEMBER 1: Which is why you should be focusing on phase 2, it was designed for exactly...
FURY: PHASE 2 isn't ready, our enemy is. We need a response team.
COUNCIL MEMBER 1: The Avengers Initiative was shut down.
FURY: This isn't about The Avengers.
COUNCIL MEMBER 1: We're running the world's greatest covert security network and you're gonna leave the fate of human race to a handful of freaks.
FURY: I'm not leaving anything to anyone. We need a response team. These people maybe isolated, unbalanced even, but I believe with the right push they can be exactly what we need.
COUNCIL MEMBER 2: You believe?
COUNCIL MEMBER 1: War isn't won by sentiment, Director.
FURY: No, it's won by soldiers.
STEVE:  There's not enough time! I gotta put her in the water!
PEGGY CARTER:  You won't be alone.
SHIELD SCIENCETIST:  Oh my god!
SHIELD SCIENCETIST: This guy is still alive!
FURY: Trouble sleeping?
STEVE: I slept for seventy years, sir. I think I've had my fill.
FURY: Then you should be out, celebrating, seeing the world.
STEVE: I went under, the world was at war, I wake up, they say we won. They didn't say what we lost.
FURY: We've made some mistakes along the way. Some very recently.
STEVE: You here with a mission, sir?
FURY: I am.
STEVE: Trying to get me back in the world?
FURY: Trying to save it.
STEVE: Hydra's secret weapon.
FURY: Howard Stark fished that out of the ocean when he was looking for you. He thought what we think, the Tesseract could be the key to unlimited sustainable energy. That's something the world sorely needs.
STEVE: Who took it from you?
FURY: He's called Loki. He's not from around here. There's a lot we'll have to bring you up to speed on if you're in. The world has gotten even stranger than you already know.
STEVE: At this point, I doubt anything would surprise me.
FURY: Ten bucks says you're wrong. There's a debriefing package waiting for you back at your apartment.
FURY: Is there anything you can tell us about the Tesseract that we ought to know now?
STEVE:  You should have left it in the ocean.
Tony Stark: You're good on this end. The rest is up to you.
PEPPER POTTS:  You disconnected the transition lines? Are we off the grid?
Tony Stark: Stark Tower is about to become a beacon of self-sustaining clean energy.
PEPPER: Wow. So maybe our reactor takes over, and it actually works?
Tony Stark: I assume. Light her up.
PEPPER: How does it look?
Tony Stark: Like Christmas, but with more... me.
PEPPER Gotta go wider on the public awareness campaign. You need to do some press. I'm in DC tomorrow. I'm working on the zoning for the next three buildings.
Tony Stark: Pepper, you're killing me. Remember the moment? Enjoy the moment.
PEPPER: Then get in here and I will.
JARVIS: Sir, Agent Coulson of SHIELD is on the line.
Tony Stark: I'm not in. I'm actually out.
JARVIS: Sir, I'm afraid he's insisting.
Tony Stark: Grow a spine, Jarvis. I got a date.
PEPPER: Levels are holding steady... I think.
Tony Stark: Of course they are, I was directly involved. Which brings me to my next question: how does it feel to be a genius?
PEPPER: Well, ha, I really wouldn't know now, would I?
Tony Stark: What do you mean? All this came from you.
PEPPER: No. All this came from that.
Tony Stark: Give yourself some credit, please. Stark Tower is your baby. Give yourself... twelve percent of the credit.
PEPPER: Twelve percent?
Tony Stark: An argument can be made for fifteen.
PEPPER: Twelve percent? For my baby?
Tony Stark: Well, I did do all the heavy lifting. Literally, I lifted the heavy things. And sorry, but the security snafu? That was on you.
PEPPER: Oooooh.
Tony Stark: My private elevator...
PEPPER: You mean our elevator?
Tony Stark: Was steaming with sweaty workmen. I'm going to pay for that comment about percentages in some subtle way later, aren't I?
PEPPER: Not gonna be that subtle.
Tony Stark: I'll tell you what. Next building's gonna say 'Potts' on the tower.
PEPPER: On the lease.
Tony Stark: Call your mom, can you bunk over?
JARVIS: Sir, the telephone. I'm afraid my protocols are being overwritten.
COULSON: Stark, we need to talk.
Tony Stark: You have reached the life model decoy of Tony Stark, please leave a message.
COULSON: This is urgent.
Tony Stark: Then leave it urgently.  Security breach.  That's on you.
COULSON: Mr. Stark
PEPPER: Phil! Come in.
Tony Stark: Phil? Uh, his first name is Agent.
PEPPER: Come on in, we're celebrating.
COULSON: I can't stay
Tony Stark: Which is why he can't stay.
COULSON: We need you to look this over.  Soon as possible.
Tony Stark: I don't like being handed things.
PEPPER: That's alright, 'cause I love to be handed things. So, let's trade.  Thank you.
Tony Stark: Official consulting hours are between eight and five every other Thursday.
COULSON: This isn't a consultation.
PEPPER: Is this about The Avengers? Which I...I know nothing about.
Tony Stark: The Avengers Initiative was scrapped, I thought. And I didn't even qualify.
PEPPER: I didn't know that either.
Tony Stark: Yeah, apparently I'm volatile, self-obsessed, don't play well with others.
PEPPER: That I did know.
COULSON: This isn't about personality profiles anymore.
Tony Stark: Whatever. Miss Potts, got a minute?
Tony Stark: You know, I thought we were having a moment.
PEPPER: I was having twelve percent of a moment. This seems serious, Phil's pretty shaken.
Tony Stark: How did you notice? Why is he Phil?
PEPPER: What is all of this?
Tony Stark: This is, uh...  This.
PEPPER: I'm going to take the jet to DC tonight.
Tony Stark: Tomorrow.
PEPPER: You've got homework. You've got a lot of homework.
Tony Stark: Well, what if I didn't?
PEPPER: If you didn't?
Tony Stark: Yeah.
PEPPER: You mean if you finished?  Well, um...then.
Tony Stark: Square deal. It's the last date.
PEPPER: Work hard.
PILOT: We're about forty minutes out from base, sir.
STEVE: So, this Doctor Banner was trying to replicate the serum that was used on me?
COULSON: A lot of people were. You were the world's first superhero. Banner thought gamma radiation might hold the key to unlocking Erskine's original formula.
STEVE: Didn't really go his way, did it?
COULSON: Not so much. When he's not that thing though, guy's like a Stephen Hawking.  He's like a smart person. I gotta say, it's an honor to meet you, officially.  I sort of met you, I mean, I watched you while you were sleeping.  I mean, I was... I was present while you were unconscious from the ice. You know, it's really, it's just a... just a huge honor to have you on board.
STEVE: Well, I hope I'm the man for the job.
COULSON: Oh, you are. Absolutely. Uh... we've made some modifications to the uniform. I had a little design input.
STEVE: The uniform? Aren't the stars and stripes a little... old fashioned?
COULSON: With everything that's happening, the things that are about to come to light, people might just need a little old fashioned.
THE OTHER: The Chitauri grow restless
LOKI: Let them go at themselves. I will lead them into glorious battle.
THE OTHER: Battle? Against the meager might of Earth?
LOKI: Glorious, not lengthy. If your force is as formidable as you claim.
THE OTHER: You question us? You question him? He who put the scepter in your hand, who gave you ancient knowledge and new purpose when you were cast out, defeated?
LOKI: I was a king! The rightful king of Asgard! Betrayed!
THE OTHER: Your ambition is little, born of childish need. We look beyond the Earth to greater worlds the Tesseract will unveil.
LOKI: You don't have the Tesseract yet.  I don't threaten, but until I open the doors, until your force is mine to command, you are but words.
THE OTHER: You will have your war, Asgardian. If you fail, if the Tesseract is kept from us, there will be no realm, no barren moon, no crevice where he can't find you. You think you know pain? He will make you long for something as sweet as pain.
COULSON: Agent Romanoff, Captain Rogers.
STEVE: Ma'am?
NATASHA: Hi.  They need you on the bridge. They're starting the face-trace.
COULSON: See you there.
NATASHA: It was quite the buzz around here, finding you in the ice. I thought Coulson was gonna swoon. Did he ask you to sign his Captain America trading cards yet?
STEVE: Trading cards?
NATASHA: They're vintage, he's very proud.
STEVE: Dr. Banner.
BRUCE: Oh, yeah. Hi. They told me you'd be coming.
STEVE: Word is you can find the cube.
BRUCE: Is that the only word on me?
STEVE: Only word I care about.
BRUCE:  It must be strange for you, all of this.
STEVE:  Well, this is actually kind of familiar.
NATASHA: Gentlemen, you might want to step inside in a minute. It's gonna get a little hard to breath.
STEVE: Is this a submarine?
BRUCE: Really? They wanted me in a submerged, pressurized metal container?
BRUCE: Oh, no. This is much worse.
HILL: We're at lock, sir.
FURY: Good. Let's vanish.
FURY: Gentlemen.  Doctor, thank you for coming.
BRUCE: Thanks for asking nicely. So, uh... how long am I staying?
FURY: Once we get our hands on the Tesseract, you're in the clear.
BRUCE: Where are you with that?
COULSON: We're sweeping every wirelessly accessible camera on the planet. Cellphones, laptops. If it's connected to a satellite, it's eyes and ears for us.
NATASHA: That's still not gonna find them in time.
BRUCE: You have to narrow the field. How many spectrometers do you have access to?
FURY: How many are there?
BRUCE: Call every lab you know, tell them to put the spectrometers on the roof and calibrate them for gamma rays. I'll rough out a tracking algorithm based on cluster recognition. At least we could rule out a few places. Do you have somewhere for me to work?
FURY: Agent Romanoff, would you show Dr. Banner to his laboratory, please.
NATASHA: You're gonna love it, Doc. We got all the toys.
SELVIG: Put it over there!  Where did you find all these people?
CLINT: SHIELD has not shortage of enemies, Doctor. . Is this the stuff you need?
SELVIG: Yeah, iridium. It's found in meteorites, it forms anti-protons. It's very hard to get hold of.
CLINT: Especially if SHIELD knows you need it.
SELVIG: Well, I didn't know!  Hey! The Tesseract is showing me so much. It's more than just knowledge, it's... truth.
LOKI: I know. What did it show you, Agent Barton?
CLINT: My next target.
LOKI: Tell me what you need.
CLINT: I'll need a distraction.  And an eyeball.
COULSON: I mean, if it's not too much trouble.
STEVE: No, no. It's fine.
COULSON: It's a vintage set. It took me a couple of years to collect them all. Near mint, slight foxing around the edges, but...
AGENT JASPER SITWELL: We got a hit. Sixty-seven percent match. Weight, cross match, seventy-nine percent.
AGENT PHIL COULSON: Location?
SITWELL: Stuttgart, Germany. 28, Konigstrasse. He's not exactly hiding.
FURY: Captain, you're up.
LOKI: Kneel before me.  I said KNEEL!  Is not this simpler? Is this not your natural state? It's the unspoken truth of humanity, that you crave subjugation. The bright lure of freedom diminishes your life's joy in a mad scramble for power, for identity. You were made to be ruled. In the end, you will always kneel.
ELDER GERMAN MAN:  Not to men like you.
LOKI: There are no men like me.
ELDER GERMAN MAN: There are always men like you.
LOKI: Look to your elder, people. Let him be an example.
CAPTAIN AMERICA: You know, the last time I was in Germany and saw a man standing above everybody else, we ended up disagreeing.
LOKI:  The soldier. A man out of time.
CAPTAIN AMERICA: I'm not the one who's out of time.
NATASHA: Loki, drop the weapon and stand down.
LOKI: Kneel.
CAPTAIN AMERICA: Not today!
NATASHA: This guy's all over the place.
Tony Stark: Agent Romanoff, did you miss me?  Make your move, Reindeer Games.
Tony Stark: Good move.
CAPTAIN AMERICA: Mr. Stark.
Tony Stark: Captain.
INT. QUINJET - NIGHT
NICK FURY : Said anything?
NATASHA: Not a word.
NICK FURY : Just get him here. We're low on time.
STEVE: I don't like it.
Tony Stark: What? Rock of Ages giving up so easily?
STEVE: I don't remember it being ever that easy. This guy packs a wallop.
Tony Stark: Still, you are pretty spry, for an older fellow. What's your thing? Pilates?
STEVE: What?
Tony Stark: It's like calisthenics. You might have missed a couple things, you know, during your time as a Capsicle.
STEVE: Fury didn't tell me he was calling you in.
Tony Stark: Yeah, there's a lot of things Fury doesn't tell you.
NATASHA: Where's this coming from?
STEVE: What's the matter? Scared of a little lightning?
LOKI: I'm not overly fond of what follows.
Tony Stark: Now there's that guy.
NATASHA: Another Asgardian?
CAPTAIN AMERICA: Think the guy's a friendly?
Tony Stark: Doesn't matter. If he frees Loki or kills him, the Tesseract's lost. Tony turns and gets ready to jump off the jet to chase after Thor.
CAPTAIN AMERICA: Stark, we need a plan of attack!
Tony Stark: I have a plan. Attack.
NATASHA: I'd sit this one out, Cap.
CAPTAIN AMERICA: I don't see how I can.
NATASHA: These guys come from legends, they're basically gods.
CAPTAIN AMERICA: There's only one God, ma'am. And I'm pretty sure he doesn't dress like that.
THOR: Where is the Tesseract?
LOKI:  I missed you too.
THOR: Do I look to be in a gaming mood?!
LOKI: Oh, you should thank me. With the Bifrost gone how much dark energy did the Allfather have to muster to conjure you here? Your precious Earth.
THOR: I thought you died.
LOKI: Did you mourn?
THOR: We all did. Our father...
LOKI: Your father. He did tell you my true parentage, did he not? Thor lets go Loki, who walks away from Thor, causing an even bigger wedge between them.
THOR: We were raised together, we played together, we fought together. Do you remember none of that?
LOKI:  I remember a shadow. Living in the shade of your greatness. I remember you tossing me into an abyss. I was and should be king!
THOR: So you take the world I love as recompense for your imagined slights. No, the Earth is under my protection, Loki.
LOKI:  And you're doing a marvelous job with that. The humans slaughter each other in droves, while you idly threat. I mean to rule them. And why should I not?
THOR: You think yourself above them.
LOKI: Well, yes.
THOR: Then you miss the truth of ruling, brother. Throne would suit you ill.
LOKI: I've seen worlds you've never known about! I have grown, Odinson, in my exile! I have seen the true power of the Tesseract, and when I wield it...
THOR: Who showed you this power? Who controls the would-be-king?
LOKI: I am a king!
THOR: Not here! You give up the Tesseract! You give up this poisonous dream! You come home.
LOKI: I don't have it. You need the cube to bring me home, but I've sent it off. I know not where.
THOR: You listen well, brother. I...
LOKI: I'm listening.
EXT. FOREST - CONTINUOUS
THOR: Do not touch me again!
Tony Stark: Then don't take my stuff.
THOR: You have no idea what you're dealing with.
Tony Stark: Shakespeare in the park? Doth mother know you weareth her drapes?
THOR: This is beyond you, metal man. Loki will face Asgardian justice!
Tony Stark: He gives up the Cube, he's all yours. Until then, stay out of my way... tourist.
The IRON MAN helmet clamps up and he walks away. In one quick move, Thor pulls Mjölnir, throws it, and KNOCKS IRON MAN clear across into a tree.
Tony Stark: Okay.
Right back at you, bitch!
JARVIS: Power at 400% capacity.
Tony Stark: How about that?
EXT. SKY - NIGHT
EXT. FOREST - CONTINUOUS
CAPTAIN AMERICA: Hey! That's enough!  Now, I don't know what you plan on doing here.
THOR: I've come here to put an end to Loki's schemes!
CAPTAIN AMERICA: Then prove it! Put the hammer down.
Tony Stark: Um, yeah, no! Bad call! He loves his hammer!
THOR:  You want me to put the hammer down?
CAPTAIN AMERICA: Are we done here?
INT. HELICARRIER HALLWAY - NIGHT
INT. HELICARRIER DETENTION SECTION - NIGHT
NICK FURY: In case it's unclear. You try to escape. You so much as scratch that glass.
NICK FURY: Thirty thousand feet, straight down in a steel trap. You get how that works?!
NICK FURY: Ant.
NICK FURY: Boot.
LOKI:  It's an impressive cage. Not built, I think, for me.
NICK FURY: Built for something a lot stronger than you.
LOKI: Oh, I've heard.
INT. BRIEFING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
INT. HELICARRIER DETENTION SECTION - CONTINUOUS
LOKI: The mindless beast, makes play he's still a man. How desperate are you, that you call upon such lost creatures to defend you?
NICK FURY: How desperate am I? You threaten my world with war. You steal a force you can't hope to control. You talk about peace and you kill `cause it's fun. You have made me very desperate. You might not be glad that you did.
LOKI: Ooh. It burns you to come so close. To have the Tesseract, to have power, unlimited power. And for what? A warm light for all mankind to share, and then to be reminded what real power is.
NICK FURY:  Well, you let me know if Real Power wants a magazine or something.
INT. BRIEFING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
BANNER: He really grows on you, doesn't he?
STEVE: Loki's gonna drag this out. So, Thor, what's his play?
THOR:  He has an army called the Chitauri. They're not of Asgard or any world known. He means to lead them against your people. They will win him the earth. In return, I suspect, for the Tesseract.
STEVE:  An army? From outer space?
BANNER: So he's building another portal. That's what he needs Erik Selvig for.
THOR: Selvig?
BANNER: He's an astrophysicist.
THOR: He's a friend.
NATASHA: Loki has him under some kind of spell, along with one of ours.
STEVE: I wanna know why Loki let us take him. He's not leading an army from here.
BANNER: I don't think we should be focusing on Loki. That guy's brain is a bag full of cats, you could smell crazy on him.
THOR: Have care how you speak. Loki is beyond reason, but he is of Asgard, and he's my brother.
NATASHA: He killed eighty people in two days.
THOR: He's adopted.
BANNER: I think it's about the mechanics. Iridium, what did they need the Iridium for?
Tony Stark: It's a stabilizing agent.  I'll fly you there. Keep the love alive. Means the portal won't collapse on itself, like it did at SHIELD.
Tony Stark: No hard feelings, Point Break. You've got a mean swing.  Also, it means the portal can open as wide, and stay open as long, as Loki wants.  Uh, raise the mid-mast, ship the top sails. That man is playing GALAGA! Thought we wouldn't notice. But we did.  How does Fury do this?
AGENT MARIA HILL: He turns.
Tony Stark: Well, that sounds exhausting. The rest of the raw materials, Agent Barton can get his hands on pretty easily. Only major component he still needs is a power source. A high energy density, something to kick start the cube.
AGENT MARIA HILL: When did you become an expert in thermonuclear astrophysics?
Tony Stark: Last night. The packet, Selvig's notes, the Extraction Theory papers. Am I the only one who did the reading?
STEVE: Does Loki need any particular kind of power source?
BANNER: He's got to heat the cube to a hundred and twenty million Kelvin just to break through the Coulomb barrier.
Tony Stark: Unless, Selvig has figured out how to stabilize the quantum tunneling effect.
BANNER: Well, if he could do that he could achieve Heavy Ion Fusion at any reactor on the planet.
Tony Stark: Finally, someone who speaks English.
STEVE: Is that what just happened?
TONY : It's good to meet you, Dr. Banner. Your work on anti-electron collisions is unparalleled. And I'm a huge fan of the way you lose control and turn into an enormous green rage monster.
BANNER:  Thanks.
NICK FURY:  Dr. Banner is only here to track the cube. I was hoping you might join him.
STEVE: Let's start with that stick of his. It may be magical, but it works an awful lot like a HYDRA weapon.
NICK FURY: I don't know about that, but it is powered by the cube. And I'd like to know how Loki used it to turn two of the sharpest men I know into his personal flying monkeys.
THOR: Monkeys? I do not understand.
STEVE: I do! I understood that reference.
Tony Stark: Shall we play, doctor?
BANNER: Let's play some.
INT. BANNER'S LAB - NIGHT
BANNER: The gamma readings are definitely consistent with Selvig's reports on the Tesseract. But it's gonna take weeks to process.
Tony Stark: If we bypass their mainframe and direct a reroute to the Homer cluster, we can clock this around six hundred teraflops.
BANNER: All I packed was a toothbrush.
Tony Stark:  You know, you should come by STARK TOWER sometime. Top ten floors, all R&D. You'd love it, it's candy land.
BANNER: Thanks, but the last time I was in New York I kind of broke...Harlem.
Tony Stark: Well, I promise a stress free environment. No tension. No surprises.
BANNER: OW!
STEVE: Hey!
Tony Stark: Nothing?
STEVE: Are you nuts?
Tony Stark: You really have got a lid on it, haven't you? What's your secret? Mellow jazz? Bongo drums? Huge bag of weed?
STEVE: Is everything a joke to you?
Tony Stark: Funny things are.
STEVE: Threatening the safety of everyone on this ship isn't funny. No offense, Doctor.
BANNER: No, it's alright. I wouldn't have come aboard if I couldn't handle pointy things.
Tony Stark: You're tiptoeing, big man. You need to strut.
STEVE: And you need to focus on the problem, Mr. Stark.
Tony Stark: You think I'm not? Why did Fury call us and why now? Why not before? What isn't he telling us? I can't do the equation unless I have all the variables.
STEVE: You think Fury's hiding something?
Tony Stark: He's a spy. Captain, he's the spy. His secrets have secrets.  It's bugging him too, isn't it?
BANNER:  Uh...I just wanna finish my work here and...
STEVE: Doctor?
BANNER: 'A warm light for all mankind, Loki's jab at Fury about the cube.
STEVE: I heard it.
BANNER:  Well, I think that was meant for you. Even if Barton didn't post that all over the news.
STEVE: Stark Tower? That big ugly  ...building in New York?
BANNER: It's powered by Stark Reactors, self-sustaining energy source. That building will run itself for what, a year?
Tony Stark: That's just the prototype. I'm kind of the only name in clean energy right now.
BANNER:  So, why didn't SHIELD bring him in on the Tesseract project? I mean, what are they doing in the energy business in the first place?
Tony Stark: I should probably look into that once my decryption programmer finishes breaking into all of SHIELD's secure files.
STEVE:  I'm sorry, did you say...?
Tony Stark: Jarvis has been running it since I hit the bridge. In a few hours we'll know every dirty secret SHIELD has ever tried to hide.  Blueberry?
STEVE: Yet you're confused about why they didn't want you around?
Tony Stark: An intelligence organization that fears intelligence? Historically, not possible.
STEVE: I think Loki's trying to wind us up. This is a man who means to start a war, and if don't stay focused, he'll succeed. We have orders, we should follow them.
Tony Stark: Following is not really my style.
STEVE:  And you're all about style, aren't you?
Tony Stark:  Of the people in this room, which one is; A. wearing a spangly outfit, and B. not of use?
BANNER: Steve, tell me none of this smells a little funky to you?
STEVE: Just find the cube.
BACK IN THE LAB
Tony Stark: That's the guy my dad never shut up about? Wondering if they shouldn't have kept him on ice.
BANNER: The guy's not wrong about Loki. He does have the jump on us.
Tony Stark: What he's got is an ACME dynamite kit. It's gonna blow up in his face, and I'm gonna be there when it does.
BANNER: And I'll read all about it.
Tony Stark: Uh-huh. Or you'll be suiting up like the rest of us.
BANNER: Ah, see. I don't get a suit of armor. I'm exposed, like a nerve. It's a nightmare.
Tony Stark: You know, I've got a cluster of shrapnel, trying every second to crawl its way into my heart.  This stops it. This little circle of light. It's part of me now, not just armor. It's a... terrible privilege.
BANNER: But you can control it.
Tony Stark: Because I learned how.
BANNER: It's different.
Tony Stark: Hey, I've read all about your accident. That much gamma exposure should have killed you.
BANNER: So you're saying that the Hulk... the other guy... saved my life? That's nice. It's a nice sentiment. Saved it for what?
Tony Stark:  I guess we'll find out.
BANNER: You might not like that.
Tony Stark: You just might.

AGENT PHIL COULSON: As soon as Loki took the doctor we moved Jane Foster. We've got an excellent observatory in Tromso. She was asked to consult there very suddenly yesterday. Handsome fee, private plane, very remote. She'll be safe.
THOR: Thank you. It's no accident Loki taking Erik Selvig; I dread what he plans for him once he's done. Erik is a good man.
AGENT PHIL COULSON: He talks about you a lot. You changed his life. You changed everything around here.
THOR: They were better as they were. We pretend on Asgard that we're more advanced, but we... we come here battling like BILGESNIPE.
AGENT PHIL COULSON: Like what?
THOR: BILGESNIPE? You know; huge, scaly, big antlers. You don't have those?
AGENT PHIL COULSON: Don't think so.
THOR: They are repulsive, and they trample everything in their path.
THOR: When I first came to Earth, Loki's rage followed me here and your people paid the price. And now again. In my youth I courted war.
NICK FURY : War hasn't started yet.  You think you can make Loki tell us what the Tesseract is?
THOR: I do not know. Loki's mind is far afield, it's not just power he craves, it's vengeance upon me. There's no pain that would prize his need from him.
NICK FURY: A lot of guys think that, until the pain stops.
THOR: What are you asking me to do?
NICK FURY: I'm asking, what are you prepared to do?
THOR: Loki is a prisoner.
NICK FURY: Then why do I feel like he's the only person on this boat that wants to be here?
INT. HELICARRIER DETENTION SECTION - NIGHT
LOKI: There's not many people that can sneak up on me.
NATASHA: But you figured I'd come.
LOKI: After. After whatever tortures Fury can concoct, you would appear as a friend, as a balm. And I would cooperate.
NATASHA: I wanna know what you've done to Agent Barton.
LOKI: I'd say I've expanded his mind.
NATASHA: And once you've won. Once you're king of the mountain. What happens to his mind?
LOKI: Is this love, Agent Romanoff?
NATASHA: Love is for children. I owe him a debt.
LOKI:  Tell me.
NATASHA:  Before I worked for SHIELD, I uh...well, I made a name for myself. I have a very specific skillset. I didn't care who I used it for, or on. I got on SHIELD's radar in a bad way. Agent Barton was sent to kill me, he made a different call.
LOKI: And what will you do if I vow to spare him?
NATASHA: Not let you out.
LOKI:  Ah, no. But I like this. Your world in the balance, and you bargain for one man?
NATASHA: Regimes fall every day. I tend not to weep over that, I'm Russian... or was.
LOKI: What is it you want?
NATASHA: It's really not that complicated. I've got red in my ledger, I'd like to wipe it out.
LOKI: Can you? Can you wipe out that much red? DRAKOV'S daughter? SÃO PAULO? THE HOSPITAL FIRE? Barton told me everything. Your ledger is dripping, it's gushing red, and you think saving a man no more virtuous than yourself will change anything?  This is the basest sentimentality. This is a child at prayer... PATHETIC!
INTERCUTS - Tony and Banner continuously work at their monitors.
LOKI : You lie and kill in the service of liars and killers.
LOKI  You pretend to be separate, to have your own code, something that makes up for the horrors. But they are a part of you, and they will never go away!
INT. HELICARRIER DETENTION SECTION - NIGHT
LOKI: I won't touch Barton. Not until I make him kill you! Slowly. Intimately. In every way he knows you fear! And when he'll wake just long enough to see his good work, and when he screams, I'll split his skull! This is my bargain, you mewling quim!
NATASHA:  You're a monster.
LOKI:  No, you brought the monster.
NATASHA:  So, Banner... that's your play.
LOKI:  What?
NATASHA:  Loki means to unleash the Hulk. Keep Banner in the lab, I'm on my way. Send Thor as well.  Thank you for your cooperation.
INT. BANNER'S LAB - MORNING
NICK FURY:  What are you doing, Mr. Stark?
Tony Stark: Uh...kind of been wondering the same thing about you.
NICK FURY: You're supposed to be locating the Tesseract.
BANNER: We are. The model's locked and we're sweeping for the signature now. When we get a hit, we'll have the location within half a mile.
Tony Stark: And you'll get your cube back, no muss, no fuss.  What is PHASE 2?
STEVE: PHASE 2 is SHIELD uses the cube to make weapons.  Sorry, the computer was moving a little slow.
NICK FURY:  Rogers, we gathered everything related to the Tesseract. This does not mean that we're...
Tony Stark: I'm sorry, Nick.
Tony Stark: What were you lying?
STEVE: I was wrong, director. The world hasn't changed a bit.
BANNER: Did you know about this?
NATASHA: You wanna think about removing yourself from this environment, doctor?
BANNER: I was in Calcutta, I was pretty well removed.
NATASHA: Loki's manipulating you.
BANNER: And you've been doing what exactly?
NATASHA: You didn't come here because I bat my eyelashes at you.
BANNER: Yes, and I'm not leaving because suddenly you get a little twitchy. I'd like to know why SHIELD is using the Tesseract to build weapons of mass destruction.
NICK FURY: Because of him.
THOR:  Me?
NICK FURY: Last year, Earth had a visitor from another planet who had a grudge match that leveled a small town. We learned that not only are we not alone, but we are hopelessly, hilariously, outgunned.
THOR: My people want nothing but peace with your planet.
NICK FURY: But you're not the only people out there, are you? And, you're not the only threat. The world's filling up with people who can't be matched, they can't be controlled.
STEVE: Like you controlled the cube?
THOR: Your work with the Tesseract is what drew Loki to it, and his allies. It is the signal to all the realms that the earth is ready for a higher form of war.
STEVE: A higher form?
NICK FURY: You forced our hand. We had to come up with something.
Tony Stark: Nuclear deterrent. `Cause that always calms everything right down.
NICK FURY: Remind me again how you made your fortune, Stark?
STEVE: I'm sure if he still made weapons, Stark would be neck deep...
Tony Stark: Wait! Wait! Hold on! How is this now about me?
STEVE: I'm sorry, isn't everything?
THOR: I thought humans were more evolved than this.
NICK FURY: Excuse me, did WE come to YOUR planet and blow stuff up?
THOR: Did you always give your champions such mistrust?
NATASHA: Are you all really that naive? S.H.I.E.L.D monitors potential threats.
BANNER: Captain America is on the threat potential watch list?
Tony Stark:  You're on that list? Are you above or below angry bees?
STEVE: I swear to God, Stark, one more crack...
Tony Stark: Threatening! I feel threatened!

BANNER: It's his M.O., isn't it? I mean, what are we, a team? No, no, no. We're a chemical mixture that makes chaos. We're... we're a time-bomb.
NICK FURY: You need to step away.
Tony Stark:  Why shouldn't the guy let off a little steam?
STEVE: You know damn well why! Back off!
Tony Stark:  Oh, I'm starting to want you to make me.
STEVE: Big man in a suit of armor. Take that off, what are you?
Tony Stark: Genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist.
STEVE: I know guys with none of that worth ten of you. Yeah, I've seen the footage. The only thing you really fight for is yourself. You're not the guy to make the sacrifice play, to lay down on a wire and let the other guy crawl over you.
Tony Stark: I think I would just cut the wire.
STEVE:  Always a way out... You know, you may not be a threat, but you better stop pretending to be a hero.
Tony Stark:  A hero? Like you? You're a lab rat, Rogers. Everything special about you came out of a bottle!

BANNER: Where? You rented my room.
NICK FURY: The cell was just in case…
BANNER: In case you needed to kill me, but you can't! I know! I tried!  I got low. I didn't see an end, so I put a bullet in my mouth and the other guy spit it out! So I moved on. I focused on helping other people. I was good, until you dragged me back into this freak show and put everyone here at risk!
unnerved.]
BANNER: You wanna know my secret, Agent Romanoff? You wanna know how I stay calm?
STEVE: Doctor Banner... put down the scepter.
Tony Stark: Got it.
BANNER: Sorry, kids. You don't get to see my little party trick after all.
THOR: Located the Tesseract?
Tony Stark: I can get there faster.
STEVE: Look, all of us…

Yes, we were going to build an arsenal with the Tesseract. I never put all my chips on that number though, because I was playing something even riskier. There was an idea, Stark knows this, called THE AVENGERS INITIATIVE. The idea was to bring together a group of remarkable people, see if they could become something more. See if they could work together when we needed them to, to fight the battles that we never could. Phil Coulson died still believing in that idea, in heroes.

NATASHA: Don't. Don't do that to yourself, Clint. This is Loki. This is monsters and magic and nothing we were ever trained for.
CLINT BARTON: Loki, he got away?
NATASHA: Yeah. I don't suppose you know where?
CLINT BARTON: I didn't need to know. I didn't ask. He's gonna make his play soon though. Today.

STEVE: Sometimes there isn't a way out, Tony.
Tony Stark:  Right. How did that work for him?
STEVE: Is this the first time you've lost a soldier?
Tony Stark:  WE ARE NOT SOLDIERS! I am not marching to Fury's fife!
STEVE: Neither am I! He's got the same blood on his hands as Loki does. Right now we've got to put that aside and get this done. Now Loki needs a power source, if we can put together a list…
Tony Stark:  He made it personal.
STEVE: That's not the point.
Tony Stark: That is the point. That's Loki's point. He hit us all right where we live. Why?
STEVE: To tear us apart.
Tony Stark: He had to conquer his greed, but he knows he has to take us out to win, right? That's what he wants. He wants to beat us and he wants to be seen doing it. He wants an audience.
STEVE: Right, I caught his act at Stuttgart.

Tony Stark: No, no, no! Threatening. No drink? You sure? I'm having one.
LOKI: The CHITAURI are coming, nothing will change that. What have I to fear?
Tony Stark: THE AVENGERS.  It's what we call ourselves, sort of like a team. `EARTH'S MIGHTIEST HEROES' type of thing.
LOKI: Yes, I've met them.
Tony Stark:  Yeah, takes us a while to get any traction, I'll give you that one. But, let's do a head count here. Your brother, the demigod; a super soldier, a living legend who kind of lives up to the legend; a man with breath-taking anger management issues; a couple of master assassins, and you, big fella, you've managed to piss off every single one of them.
LOKI: That was the plan.
Tony Stark: Not a great plan. When they come, and they will, they'll come for you.
LOKI: I have an army.
Tony Stark: We have a HULK.
LOKI: I thought the beast had wandered off.
Tony Stark: You're missing the point. There's no throne, there is no version of this, where you come out on top. Maybe your army comes and maybe it's too much for us, but it's all on you. Because if we can't protect the Earth, you can be damned well sure we'll avenge it.
LOKI:  How will your friends have time for me,when they're so busy fighting you?
LOKI: It should work.
Tony Stark: Well, performance issues. You know? Not uncommon. One out of five…

CAPTAIN AMERICA: I need men in these buildings. There are people inside that can run into the line of fire. You take them through the basement or through the subway. You keep them off the streets. I need a perimeter as far back as 39th.

THOR: I have unfinished business with Loki.
HAWKEYE: Yeah, get in line.
CAPTAIN AMERICA: Save it. Loki's gonna keep this fight focused on us and that's what we need. Without him these things could run wild. We got Stark up top, he's gonna need us…
BANNER: So, this all seems horrible.
BLACK WIDOW: I've seen worse.

Stark, you got the perimeter. Anything gets more than three blocks out, you turn it back or your turn it to ash.
HAWKEYE: Wanna give me a lift?
Tony Stark: Right. Better clench up, LEGOLAS.

[BLACK WIDOW walks up the CMS machine. Selvig, slumped down, weakened, looks at her desperately. The Tesseract's energy is firing towards the portal, gaining in strength, at the surge of energy moving through the sky.
BLACK WIDOW: Doctor.
SELVIG: Loki's scepter, the energy...the Tesseract can't fight. You can't protect against yourself.
BLACK WIDOW: It's not your fault. You didn't know what you were doing.
SELVIG: Well, actually I think I did. I built in a safety to cut the power source.
BLACK WIDOW: Loki's scepter.
SELVIG: It might be able to close the portal.  And I'm looking right at it.

Tony Stark: I'm gonna start again. Let's track this from the beginning.
Happy Hogan:  Half hour till the ball drops.

Party Guest: Tony Stark? Great speech, man!

Happy Hogan: Edifying
Maya Hansen: Unintelligible.
Tony Stark: Really?
Maya Hansen: Mmm-hmm.
Tony Stark: It's my favorite kind, a winning combo.
Maya Hansen: Where are we going?
Tony Stark: Uh, to town on each other, probably back in your room. Cause I also wanna see your research.
Maya Hansen: Okay, you can see my research, but that's...I'm not gonna show you my "town."
Ho Yinsen: Mr. Stark
Ho Yinsen.
Tony Stark: Oh, I finally met a man called "Ho."
Come here.
Ho Yinsen: I would like to introduce you to our guest, Dr. Wu.
Tony Stark:  Oh, this guy.
Ho Yinsen: Mr. Stark.
Tony Stark: Hey.  You're a heart doctor. She's going to need a cardiologist after I...
Maya Hansen: Bye.
Ho Yinsen: Perhaps another time.
Tony Stark: It started in Bern, Switzerland, 1999.

Aldrich Killian: Mr. Stark!
Tony Stark: I never thought they'd come back to bite me. Why would they?
Aldrich Killian: Oh, wow! Hey, Tony! Aldrich Killian.  I'm a big fan of your work!
Maya Hansen: My work?
Tony Stark: Who isn't? He means me.
Aldrich Killian: Well, of course. But, Miss Hansen, my organization has been tracking your research since year two of MIT.
Happy Hogan: Yeah, we're full.
Tony Stark: Oh, wow. He made it. He made the cut.
Happy Hogan: What floor are you going to, pal?
Aldrich Killian: Oh, now, that is an appropriate question. The ground floor, actually. I've got a proposal I'm putting together with myself. It's a privately-funded think tank called, Advanced Idea Mechanics.
Tony Stark: Uh... she'll take both.
Maya Hansen: Okay.
Tony Stark: One to throw away and one to not call.
Aldrich Killian: Advanced Idea Mechanics, or AIM for short.  Do you get it?
Tony Stark: I see that, cause it's on your t-shirt.
Aldrich Killian: Aw!
Tony Stark:  Ladies, follow the mullet. Ladies first.
Maya Hansen:  Thank you, I'll call you.
Tony Stark: I'm titillated by the notion of working with you.
Aldrich Killian: Yeah?
Tony Stark: Yeah, cheese clown. I'll see you up on the roof in five minutes.  I'm just going to try to get my beef wet real quick. You know what I'm talkin' about?
Aldrich Killian: I'll see you up there.
Tony Stark: Damn betcha.
[Scene change to Maya's room}
Tony Stark: Come on! I thought that was just a theory.
Maya Hansen: Well, it was. If I'm right, we can access the area of the brain that governs repair...
Tony Stark: Wow.
Maya Hansen: ...And chemically recode it.
Tony Stark: That's incredible. Essentially you're hacking into the genetic...
Both: ...Genetic operating system...
Tony Stark: ...of a...
Maya Hansen: Exactly.
Tony Stark: ...living organism.
Maya Hansen: Yes.
Tony Stark: Wow.
Maya Hansen: Is that... Can you...
Happy Hogan: What?
Maya Hansen: Can you not touch my plant? It's not...she doesn't like it. She prefers...
Tony Stark: She's not like the others.​​​​​​  Come on. Let's go in the bedroom. Happy...
Maya Hansen: That's cute, but...
Tony Stark: Leave her ficus alone.
Maya Hansen:  Because... and, no, seriously don't.
Tony Stark: And you're starting with plants?
Maya Hansen: For now, yeah.
Tony Stark: Huh.
Maya Hansen: I'm calling it Extremis.
Maya Hansen: Well, it's...
Both: Human application.
Maya Hansen: Exactly! Exactly.
Maya Hansen: Dendritic revitalization.
Tony Stark: It's revolutionary.
Maya Hansen: Disease prevention...
Tony Stark: Changes the world.
Maya Hansen: ...even limb regrowth.
Tony Stark: You're the most gifted woman I've ever met.
Maya Hansen: Wow.
Tony Stark: In Switzerland.
Maya Hansen: Hmm, that's better. Aw, you're seeing things.
Tony Stark: This week.
Tony Stark: You almost bought it, didn't you?
Maya Hansen: This is what I'm talking about, the glitch.
Tony Stark: Have you checked the telomerase algorithm?
Maya Hansen: The what?
Happy Hogan: Down! Stay down! Stay down, boss.
Tony Stark: We're good.
Happy Hogan: Stay down.
Tony Stark: You're...you're right on me. I made it.  What the hell was that?
Happy Hogan: What was that?
Maya Hansen: It's a glitch in my work. It's...
Tony Stark: She was just talking about it. Glitches happening.
Happy Hogan: It's not Y2K.
Maya Hansen: No.
Tony Stark: Hey!
Happy Hogan: Happy New Year.
Tony Stark: Happy New Year.
Maya Hansen: Happy New Year.
Tony Stark: Alright, I'll see you in the morning, goodnight.
Happy Hogan: You good?
Tony Stark: Yep.
Happy Hogan: I'll be right outside.
Tony Stark: Okay.
Tony Stark:  So why am I telling you this? Because I had just created demons, and I didn't even know it.
Tony Stark:  Yeah, those were the good times. Then I moved on. After a brief soiree in an Afghan cave, I said goodbye to the party scene. Forgot that night in Switzerland. These days I'm a changed man, I'm different now. I'm well... you know who I am.
Tony Stark: Ow!
JARVIS: Sir, please may I request just a few hours to calibrate...
Tony Stark: No. Forty-eight.  Ah! Micro-repeater implanting sequence complete.
JARVIS: As you wish, sir. I've also prepared a safety briefing for you to entirely ignore.
Tony Stark: Which I will. Right, let's do this.
Tony Stark: Dummy. Hi, Dummy. How did you get that cap on your head? You earned it.
Tony Stark: Hey. Hey! What are you doing round in the corner? You know what you did. Blood on my mat, handle it.
JARVIS: Sir, may I remind you that you've been awake for nearly seventy-two hours.
Tony Stark: Focus up, ladies. Good evening, and welcome to the birthing suite. I'm pleased to announce the imminent arrival of your bouncing, bad-ass, baby brother.
Tony Stark: Start tight and go wide, stamp in time. Mark 42 autonomous prehensile propulsion suit test. Initialize sequence.
Tony Stark: Jarvis, drop my needle.
Tony Stark: Crap.
Tony Stark: Alright, I think we got this. Send 'em all.
Tony Stark: Probably a little fast, slow it down. Slow it down just a...
Tony Stark: ...little bit.
Tony Stark: Cool it, will you, Jarvis?
Tony Stark: Come on. I ain't scared of you.
Tony Stark: I'm the best.
JARVIS: As always, sir, a great pleasure watching you work.
Tony Stark:  And I guess seventy-two hours isn't a long time between siesta's. Didn't think it could get any worse. Then I had to go and turn on the TV.
Tony Stark:  That's when he happened.
The Mandarin: Some people call me a terrorist, I consider myself a teacher. America, ready for another lesson. In 1864 in Sand Creek Colorado the U.S. military waited till the friendly Cheyenne braves all gone hunting, waited to attack and slaughter their families left behind, and claim their land. Thirty-nine hours ago the Ali Al Salem Air Base in Kuwait was attacked. I...I...I did that. A quaint military church filled with wives and children, of course. The soldiers were out on maneuvers, the braves were away. President Ellis, you continue to resist my attempts to educate you, sir. And now, you've missed me again. You know who I am, you don't know where I am, and you'll never see me coming.
News Reporter #1: And now that we seem to be back, let's recap some of the frightening...
News Reporter #2: American Airwaves were highjacked...
News Reporter #3: The nation remains on high alert...
News Reporter #4: All attempts to find the Mandarin have so far proved unsuccessful...
President Ellis: Central to my Administration's response to this terrorist event, is a newly minted resource. I know him as Colonel James Rhodes, the American people will soon know him as the Iron Patriot.
Bill Maher: And how is President Ellis responding? By taking the guy they call War Machine and giving him a paint job.
Joan Rivers: Same suit, but painted red, white, and blue. Look at rhat. And they also renamed him Iron Patriot. You know, just in case the paint was too subtle.
Colonel James Rhodes: It tested well with focus groups, alright?
Tony Stark:  I am Iron Patriot...
Colonel James Rhodes: Listen, War Machine was a little too aggressive, alright? This sends a better message.
Tony Stark: So what's really goin' on? With Mandarin. Seriously, can we talk about this guy?
Colonel James Rhodes: It's classified information, Tony. Okay, there have been nine bombings.
Tony Stark: Nine.
Colonel James Rhodes: The public only knows about three. Here's the thing, nobody can ID a device. There's no bomb casings.
Tony Stark: You know I can help, just ask. I got a ton of new tech, I got a prehensile, I got a...I got a new bomb disposal. Catches explosions mid-air.
Colonel James Rhodes: When's the last time you got a good night's sleep?
Tony Stark: Einstein slept three hours a year. Look what he did?
Colonel James Rhodes: People are concerned about you, Tony. I'm concerned about you.
Tony Stark: You're gonna come at me like that?
Colonel James Rhodes: No. No, look, I'm not trying to be a dic...
Colonel James Rhodes: ...tator.
Erin: Do you mind signing my drawing?
Tony Stark: If Richard doesn't mind.  You alright with this, Dick?
Colonel James Rhodes: Fine with me.
Tony Stark:  What's your name?
Erin: Erin.
Tony Stark: I loved you in A Christmas Story, by the way.
Colonel James Rhodes: Listen, the Pentagon is scared. After what happened in New York... aliens, come on. They need to look strong. Stopping the Mandarin is priority, but it's not...
Tony Stark: It's not superhero business, I get it.
Colonel James Rhodes: No, it's not, quite frankly. It's American business.
Tony Stark: That's why I said I...got it.
Colonel James Rhodes: Are you okay?
Tony Stark: I broke the crayon.
Erin: Are you okay, Mr. Stark?
Colonel James Rhodes: Take it easy. Tony...
Little Boy:  How did you get out of the wormhole? How did you get out of the wormhole?
Colonel James Rhodes: Wait a minute! Tony!
Tony Stark: What'd he say?!
Colonel James Rhodes: Tony!
Tony Stark: Sorry. Have to check on the suit...make sure...okay.
Tony Stark: Check the heart, check the...check the...is it the brain?
JARVIS: No sign of cardiac analomy or unusual brain activity.
Tony Stark: Okay, so I was poisoned?
Jarvis: My diagnosis is that you've experienced a severe anxiety attack.
Tony Stark: Me?
Colonel James Rhodes: Come on, man. This isn't a good look, open up.
Tony Stark: Sorry, I gotta split.
Happy Hogan: Badge. Badge. Come on, badge. Badge, guys. I put a memo in the toilet, come on.  Tony has got them in his basement, they're wearing party hats. This is an asset that we can put to use.
Pepper Potts: Uh-huh. So, you're suggesting that I replace the entire janitorial staff with robots?
Happy Hogan: What I'm saying is that the human element of Human Resources is our biggest point of vulnerability. We should start phasing it out immediately.
Pepper Potts: What!?
Happy Hogan:  Excuse me, Bambi.
Pepper Potts:  Did you just say that?
Happy Hogan: Security.
Pepper Potts: Happy?
Happy Hogan: Yes.
Pepper Potts: Okay, I am thrilled that you're now the Head of Security, okay? It is the perfect position for you.
Happy Hogan: Thank you.
Pepper Potts: However...
Happy Hogan: I do appreciate it
Pepper Potts: Since you've taken the post...
Happy Hogan: You don't have to thank me.
Pepper Potts: We've had a rise in staff complaints of three hundred percent
Happy Hogan: Thank you.
Pepper Potts: That's not a compliment.
Happy Hogan: That's not a compli...? It is a compliment! Clearly somebody's trying to hide something.
Pepper Potts: I...
Pepper's Assistant: Excuse me.
Pepper Potts: Yes?
Pepper's Assistant: Miss Potts, your four o'clock is here.
Pepper Potts: Thank you.
Happy Hogan: Did you clear this four o'clock with me?
Pepper Potts: Happy, we'll talk about this later. But right now I have to go deal with this very annoying thing.
Happy Hogan: How so?
Pepper Potts: I used to work with him, and he used to ask me out all the time. So it's a little awkward.
Happy Hogan: I don't like the sound of that.
Aldrich Killian: Pepper.
Pepper Potts: Killian?
Aldrich Killian: You look great. You look really great.
Pepper Potts: God, you look...you look great. I... I...I can't... What on earth have you been doing?
Aldrich Killian: Nothing fancy, just five years in the hands of physical therapists. And please, call me Aldrich.
Happy Hogan: Uh...you were supposed to be issued a security badge.
Pepper Potts: Happy, it's okay.
Happy Hogan: Yes?
Pepper Potts: We're good.
Happy Hogan: You sure?
Pepper Potts: Yes. Stand down.
Happy Hogan: Okay. I'm gonna linger, right here.
Pepper Potts: Thank you.
Happy Hogan: Okay.
Pepper Potts: It's very nice to see you, Killian.
Happy Hogan: Hey, guy.
Savin: Merry Christmas.
Aldrich Killian: After years dodging the President's ban on "immoral biotech research", my think tank now has a little something in the pipeline. It's an idea we like to call Extremis. I'm gonna turn your lights down.
Aldrich Killian: Regard the human brain.
Aldrich Killian: Uh...wait. Hold on, hold on. That's...that's the universe, my bad. But if I do that...
Aldrich Killian: That's the brain. Strangely mimetic though, wouldn't you say?
Pepper Potts Wow, that's amazing!
Aldrich Killian: Thanks, it's mine.
Pepper Potts: What?
Aldrich Killian: This...you're inside my head. It's a...
Aldrich Killian: It's a live feed. Come on up, I'll prove it to you.
Aldrich Killian: Come on.
Aldrich Killian: Now, pinch my arm. I can take it. Pinch me.
Pepper Potts: What is that?
Aldrich Killian: It's the primary somatosensory cortex. It's the brain's pain center. But this is what I wanted to show you.
Aldrich Killian: Now, Extremis harnesses our bioelectrical potential and it goes...here. This is essentially an empty slot, and what this tells us is that our mind, our entire DNA in fact, is destined to be upgraded.
Pepper Potts: Wow.
Happy Hogan: Hello?
Tony Stark: Is this forehead of Security?
Happy Hogan: What? You know, look, I got a real job. What do you want? I'm working, I got something going on here.
Tony Stark: What? Harassing interns?
Happy Hogan: Let me tell you something, you know what happened when I told people I was Iron Man's body guard? They would laugh in my face.
Happy Hogan: I had to leave while I still had a shred of dignity. Now I got a real job, I'm watching Pepper.
Tony Stark: What's going on? Fill me in.
Happy Hogan: For real?
Tony Stark: Yeah.
Happy Hogan: Alright, so she's meeting up with this scientist. Rich guy, handsome.
Tony Stark: Right.
Happy Hogan: I couldn't make his face at first, right? You know I'm good with faces.
Tony Stark: Oh, Yeah, yeah. You're the best.
Happy Hogan: Yeah. Well, so I run his credentials, I make him Aldrich Killian. We actually met the guy back in... where were we in '99? The science conference?
Tony Stark: Um...Switzerland.
Happy Hogan: Right, right, exactly.
Tony Stark: Killian? No, I don't remember that guy.
Happy Hogan: Of course you don't. He's not a blond with a big rack. At first it was fine, they were talking business, but now it's like getting weird. He's showing her a big brain.
Tony Stark: His what?
Happy Hogan: Big brain, and she likes it. Here, let me show you. Hold on. See?
Tony Stark: Look at what? You watching them? Flip the screen and then we can get started.
Happy Hogan: I'm not a tech genius like you. Just...just trust me, get down down here.
Tony Stark: Flip the screen, then I can see what they're doing.
Happy Hogan: I can't! I don't know how to flip the screen! Don't talk to me like that anymore. You're not my boss.
Happy Hogan: Alright, I don't work for you. Now I don't trust this guy. He's got another guy with him, he's shifty.
Tony Stark: Relax.
Happy Hogan: Seriously?
Tony Stark: I'm just asking you to secure the perimeter. Tell him to go out for a drink or something?
Happy Hogan: You know what? You should take more of an interest in what's going on here. This woman... this woman's the best thing that ever happened to you, and you...you're just ignoring her.
Tony Stark: A giant brain?
Happy Hogan: Yeah, there's a giant brain, there's a shifty character. I'm gonna follow this guy. I'm gonna run his plates and if it gets rough, so be it.
Tony Stark: I miss you, Happy.
Happy Hogan: Yeah, I miss you too. But the way it used to be. Now you're off with the 'superfriends', I don't know what's going on with you anymore. The world's getting weird...
Tony Stark: Hey, I...I'd hate to cut you off. Do you have your taser on you?
Happy Hogan: Why?
Tony Stark: I think there's a gal in HR who's trying to steal some printer ink, you should probably go over there and zap her.
Happy Hogan: Yeah, nice.
Aldrich Killian: Imagine if you could hack into the hard drive of any living organism and recode its DNA.
Pepper Potts: It would be incredible.
Aldrich Killian: Mm.
Pepper Potts: Unfortunately, to my ears it also sounds highly weaponizable. As in enhanced soldiers, private armies, and Tony is not...
Aldrich Killian: Tony. Tony. You know, I invited Tony to join AIM thirteen years ago, he turned me down. But something tells me now there is a new genius on the throne who doesn't have to answer to Tony anymore, and who has slightly less of an ego.
Pepper Potts: It's gonna be a no, Aldrich. As much as I'd like to help you.
Aldrich Killian: Well, I can't say that I'm not disappointed. But then as my father used to say, 'Failure is the fog through which we glimpse triumph.'
Pepper Potts: That's very deep.
Aldrich Killian: Mm
Pepper Potts: And I have no idea what it means.
Aldrich Killian: Well, me neither. He was kind of an idiot, my old man.
Aldrich Killian: I'm sure I'll see you again, Pepper.
Pepper Potts: Happy...
Happy Hogan: The car is ready, if you're ready to go.
Pepper Potts: Yes. I just um... God, I forgot my... other thing, so... I'm just gonna...
Pepper Potts: I'm sorry I'm late. I was... What the...? What is that?!
Pepper Potts: You're wearing this in the house now? What is that, like Mark 15?
Tony Stark: Uh...yeah. Something like that. You know everybody needs a hobby.
Pepper Potts: Oh, and you have to wear your hobby in the living room?
Tony Stark: Just breakin' it in. You know, it's always a little pinchy in the gooey bag at first, so.
Tony Stark: Oh hey, did you see your Christmas present?
Pepper Potts: Yes, I did. I...I don't know how I could have missed that Christmas present. Is it gonna fit through the door?
Tony Stark: Well actually, uh...it's a good question. I got a team of guys comin' tomorrow, they're gonna blow out that wall.
Pepper Potts: Okay.
Tony Stark: So, uh...tense? Good day?
Tony Stark: Ooh shoulders, a little knotty. Naughty girl. I don't wanna harp on this, but did you like the custom rabbit?
Pepper Potts: Did I like it?
Tony Stark: Nailed it, right?
Pepper Potts: Wow. I appreciate the thought very much.
Pepper Potts: So why don't you lift up that face mask and give me a kiss?
Tony Stark: Huh. Yup, dammit. No can do. You wanna just kiss it on the...
Pepper Potts: Uh-huh.
Tony Stark: The facial slit?
Pepper Potts: Well, why don't I run down to the garage and see if I can't find a crowbar to shimmy that thing open?
Tony Stark: Crowbar. Yeah.
Tony Stark: Oh, except there's been a...uh...a radiation leak.
Pepper Potts: I'll take my chances.
Tony Stark: That's risky.
Tony Stark: At least let me get you like a Hazmat suit or a Geiger counter or something like that.
Tony Stark: Busted.
Pepper Potts: This is a new level of lame.
Tony Stark: Sorry.
Pepper Potts: You ate without me, already? On date night?
Tony Stark:  He was just...
Pepper Potts: You mean you?
Tony Stark: Well, yeah. I just mean we were just...just hosting you while I finished up a little work.
Pepper Potts: Uh-huh.
Tony Stark: And yes, I had a quick bite. I didn't know if you were comin' home or if you were having drinks with Aldrich Killian.
Pepper Potts: What?
Tony Stark: What?
Pepper Potts: Aldrich Killian? What are you checking up on me?
Tony Stark: Happy was concerned.
Pepper Potts: No, you're spying on me.
Tony Stark: I wasn't...
Pepper Potts: I'm going to bed.
Tony Stark: Hold on. Come on. Pep.
Tony Stark: Hey, I admit it! My fault. Sorry.
Tony Stark: I'm a piping hot mess. It's been going on for a while, I haven't said anything.
Tony Stark: Nothing's been the same since New York.
Pepper Potts: Oh really? Well, I didn't notice that, at all.
Tony Stark: You experience things and then they're over and you still can't explain 'em. Gods, aliens, other dimensions. I...I'm just a man in a can. The only reason I haven't cracked up is probably because you moved in. Which is great. I love you, I'm lucky. But, honey, I can't sleep. You go to bed, I come down here. I do what I know, I tinker.
Tony Stark: But threat is imminent, and I have to protect the one thing that I can't live without. That's you. My suits, they're uh...
Pepper Potts: Machines.
Tony Stark: They're part of me.
Pepper Potts: A distraction.
Tony Stark: Maybe.
Pepper Potts: I'm gonna take a shower.
Tony Stark: Okay.
Pepper Potts: And you're gonna join me.
Tony Stark: Better.
Pepper Potts: Tony! Tony! Tony! Tony...
Tony Stark: Power down!
Tony Stark: I must have called it in my sleep. That's not supposed to happen. I'll recalibrate the sensors. Can we just...just let me...just let me catch my breath, okay?
Tony Stark: Don't go, alright? Pepper?
Pepper Potts: I'm going to sleep downstairs. Tinker with that.
Savin: Can you regulate?
Taggert: Yes, I can regulate.
Savin: Are you sure about that?
Taggert: Yes.
Savin: It's a decent batch. Don't say I never did nothin' for you.
Taggert: Thank you...I mean for understanding.
Happy Hogan: I'm sorry, buddy.
Savin: What are you doin', buddy? You out by yourself? A little date night? Watching your favorite chick flick maybe?
Happy Hogan: Yeah, a little movie called "The Party's Over", starring you and your junkie girlfriend, and here's the ticket.
Savin: No kidding? That doesn't belong to you.
Taggert: Savin!
Savin: What?
Taggert: Help! Help me!
The Mandarin: True story about fortune cookies. They look Chinese, they sound Chinese, but they're actually an American invention. Which is why they're hollow, full of lies, and leave a bad taste in the mouth. My disciples just destroyed another cheap American knock-off, The Chinese Theater. Mr. President, I know this must be getting frustrating, but this season of terror is drawing to a close. And don't worry, the big one is coming; your graduation.
Tony Stark: Hi.
Happy's Nurse: Oh.
Tony Stark:  Uh...mind leaving that on?
Happy's Nurse: Sure.
Tony Stark: Sunday night's PBS 'Downtown Abbey'. That's his show, he thinks it's elegant.  One more thing...make sure everyone wears their badges. He's a stickler for that sort of thing, plus my guys won't let anyone in without them.
Hospital News Reporter: We're awaiting the arrival of Tony Stark. We're hoping he'll give us the reaction...his reaction to the latest attack.  Mr. Stark! Mr. Stark! Our sources are telling us that this is another Mandarin attack. Anything else you can tell us?
Pushy Tabloid Reporter: Hey, Mr. Stark! When is somebody gonna kill this guy? Just sayin'.
Tony Stark: Is that what you want? Here's a little Holiday greeting I've been wanting to send to the Mandarin. I just didn't know how to phrase it until now. My name is Tony Stark and I'm not afraid of you. I know you're a coward, so I've decided  that you just died, pal. I'm gonna come get the body. There's no politics here; it's just good old-fashioned revenge. There's no Pentagon; it's just you and me. And on the off-chance you're a man, here's my home address: 10-8-80, Malibu Point, 9-0-2-6-5. I'll leave the door unlocked.  That's what you wanted, right?  Bill me.
JARVIS: I've compiled a Mandarin database for you, sir. Drawn from S.H.I.E.L.D., F.B.I., and C.I.A. intercepts. Initiating virtual crime scene reconstruction.
Tony Stark: Okay, what do we got here? His name is an ancient Chinese war mantle, meaning "adviser to the King". South American insurgency tactics, talks like a Baptist preacher. There's lots of pageantry going on here...lots of theater.  Close.
JARVIS: The heat from the blast was in excess of 3000 degrees Celsius. Any subjects within 12.5 yards were vaporized instantly.
Tony Stark: No bomb parts found in a three mile radius of the Chinese theater.
JARVIS: No, sir.
Tony Stark: Talk to me, Happy.  When is a bomb not a bomb?  When is a bomb not a bomb?  Any military victims?
JARVIS: Not according to public records, sir.
Tony Stark: Bring up the thermogenic signatures again, factor in three thousand degrees.
JARVIS: The oracle cloud has completed analysis. Accessing satellites and plotting the last twelve months of thermogenic occurrence now.
Tony Stark: Take away everywhere that there's been a Mandarin attack.  Nope.  That. You sure that's not one of his?
JARVIS: It predates any known Mandarin attack. The incident was the use of a bomb to assist a suicide.
Tony Stark: Bring her around.
JARVIS: The heat signature is remarkably similar. Three thousand degrees Celsius.
Tony Stark: That's two military guys. Ever been to Tennessee, Jarvis?
JARVIS: Creating a flight plan for Tennessee.
Tony Stark: Are we still at "ding-dong"? We're supposed to be on total security lock down. Come on, I threatened a terrorist. Who is that?
JARVIS: There's only so much I can do, sir, when you give the world's press your home address.
Tony Stark: Right there's fine.  You're not the Mandarin, are you? Are you?
Maya Hansen: You don't remember. Why am I not surprised?
Tony Stark: Don't take it personally, I don't remember what I had for breakfast.
JARVIS: Gluten-free waffles, sir.
Tony Stark: That's right.
Maya Hansen: Okay, look, I need to be alone with you. Someplace not here, it's urgent.
Tony Stark: Normally, I'd go for that sort of thing, but now I'm in a committed relationship.  It's...with her.
Pepper Potts: Tony, is somebody there?
Tony Stark: Yeah, it's Maya Hansen.  Old botanist pal that I used to know, barely.  Please don't tell me that there is a twelve year-old kid waiting in the car that I've never met.
Maya Hansen: He's thirteen. And no, I need your help.
Tony Stark: What...what for? Why now?
Maya Hansen: Because I read the papers, and, frankly, I don't think you'll last the week.
Tony Stark: I'll be fine.
Pepper Potts: I'm sorry. With Happy in the hospital, I didn't know we were expecting guests.
Tony Stark: We weren't.
Maya Hansen: No, I...
Pepper Potts: And old girlfriends!
Tony Stark: She's not really.
Maya Hansen: No, not really. It...it was just one night.
Tony Stark: Yep.
Pepper Potts: That's how you did it, isn't it? Yep.
Tony Stark: It was a great night.
Pepper Potts: Well, you know...
Maya Hansen: Yeah.
Pepper Potts: You have saved yourself a world of pain.
Maya Hansen: I'm sure.
Tony Stark: What?
Pepper Potts: Trust me.  We're going out of town.
Tony Stark: Okay, we've been through this. Nope.
Pepper Potts: Yep!
Tony Stark: The man says no.
Pepper Potts: Immediately and indefinitely!
Tony Stark: Honey...
Maya Hansen: Great idea. Let's go.
Tony Stark: I'm sorry. That's a terrible idea. Please don't touch her bags.
Pepper Potts: Tony, this is how normal people behave.
Tony Stark: I can't protect you out there. I challenged...
Maya Hansen: Is...is that normal?
Tony Stark: Yes, this is normal!
Pepper Potts: Sadly, that...is very normal.
Tony Stark: It's a big bunny, relax about it!
Pepper Potts: Calm down!
Tony Stark: I got this for you.
Pepper Potts: I'm aware of that.
Tony Stark: You still haven't even told me that you liked it!
Pepper Potts: I don't like it!
Tony Stark: I asked you three... You don't like it?!
Pepper Potts: Tony, we are leaving the house; that's not even up for discussion.
Tony Stark: I said no.
Maya Hansen: Guys, can we um...
Tony Stark: What?
Maya Hansen:  Do we need to worry about that?
Pepper Potts: I got you.
Tony Stark: I got you first. Like I said, we can't stay here.  Move! I'm right behind!  Get her, I'm gonna find a way around.  Stop stopping! Get her, get outside! Go!
Pepper Potts: Oh my God. Tony!
JARVIS: Sir, Miss Potts is clear of the structure.
Tony Stark: Jarvis, where's my flight power?!
JARVIS: Working on it, sir. This is a prototype.
Tony Stark: That's one.
JARVIS: Sir, the suit is not combat-ready.
Tony Stark: That's two.
Pepper Potts: Tony!
JARVIS: Sir, take a deep breath.  Flight power restored.
JARVIS: Sir. Sir!
Tony Stark: Alright, kill the alarm. I got it.
JARVIS: That's the emergency alert triggered by the power dropping below five percent.
Tony Stark: It's snowing, right? Where are we, upstate?
JARVIS: We're five miles outside of Rose Hills, Tennessee.
Tony Stark: Why?! Jarvis! Not my idea! What are we doing here? This is thousands of miles away, I gotta get Pepper, I gotta...
JARVIS: I prepared a flight plan. This was the location.
Tony Stark: Who asked you? Open the suit.
JARVIS: I...I think I may be malfunctioning, sir.
Tony Stark: Open eject.  That's brisk!  Maybe I'll just cozy back up for a bit.
JARVIS: I actually think I need to sleep now, sir.
Tony Stark: Jarvis. Jarvis? Don't leave me, buddy.
Computer Voice: Stark Secure Server: Now transferring to all known receivers.
Tony Stark: Pepper, it's me. I've got a lot of apologies to make and not a lot of time. So first off, I'm so sorry I put you in harm's way. That was selfish and stupid and it won't happen again. Also, it's Christmas time, the rabbit's too big. Done. Sorry. And I'm sorry in advance because...I can't come home yet. I need to find this guy. You gotta stay safe. That's all I know. I just stole a poncho from a wooden Indian.  Let's get you comfy.  You happy now?
Harley Keener: Freeze! Don't move.
Tony Stark: You got me. Nice potato gun. Barrel's a little long. Between that and the wide gauge, it's gonna diminish your FPS.  And now you're out of ammo.
Harley Keener: What's that thing on your chest?
Tony Stark: It's a electromagnet. You should know, you've got a box of them right here.
Harley Keener: What does it power?  Oh my God!  Oh my god! That... that's... Is that Iron Man?
Tony Stark: Technically, I am.
Harley Keener: Technically, you're dead.
Tony Stark: A valid point.
Harley Keener:  What happened to him?
Tony Stark: Life. I built him, I take care of him, I'll fix him.
Harley Keener: Like a mechanic?
Tony Stark: Yeah.
Harley Keener: Oh. If I was building Iron Man and War Machine.
Tony Stark:  It's Iron Patriot now.
Harley Keener: That's way cooler!
Tony Stark: No, it's not.
Harley Keener: Anyways, I would have added in um... the retro...
Tony Stark: Retroreflective panels?
Harley Keener: To make him stealth mode.
Tony Stark: You want a stealth mode?
Harley Keener: Cool, right?
Tony Stark: That's actually a good idea. Maybe I'll build one.
Harley Keener:  Oops!
Tony Stark: Not a good idea! What are you doing? You're gonna break his finger? He's in pain, he's been injured. Leave him alone.
Harley Keener: S...Sorry.
Tony Stark: Are you? Don't worry about it, I'll fix it. So, uh, who's home?
Harley Keener: Well, my mom already left for the diner and dad went to 7-Eleven to get scratchers. I... I guess he won, 'cause that was six years ago.
Tony Stark: Mm. Which happens, dads leave. No need to be a pussy about it. Here's what I need: a laptop, a digital watch, a cell phone, the pneumatic actuator from your bazooka over there, a map of town, a big spring, and a tuna fish sandwich.
Harley Keener: What's in it for me?
Tony Stark: Salvation. What's his name?
Harley Keener: Who?
Tony Stark: The kid that bullies you at school, what's his name?
Harley Keener: How'd you know that?
Tony Stark: I got just the thing.  This is a pinata for a cricket. I'm kidding, it's a very powerful weapon. Point it away from your face, press the button on top. It discourages bullying. Non-lethal, just to cover one's ass.  Deal? Deal? What'd you say?
Harley Keener: Deal.
Tony Stark: Deal?  What's you're name?
Harley Keener: Harley. And you're...
Tony Stark: The mechanic. Tony  You know what keeps going through my head? Where's my sandwich?
Computer Voice: Stark Secure Server. Retinal scan: Verified.
Tony Stark: Pepper, it's me.  I've got a lot of apologies to make and not a lot of time. So first off, I'm so sorry I put you in harm's way. That was selfish and stupid and it won't happen again.
Pepper Potts: Why were you at the house tonight? What was so important that you had to speak to Tony?
Maya Hansen:  I think that my boss is working for the Mandarin. So if you still want to talk about it, I suggest that we get ourselves someplace safe.
Pepper Potts: Your boss works for the Mandarin, you think? But Tony says you're a botanist, so...
Maya Hansen: That figures. What I actually am is a biological DNA coder running a team of forty out of a privately-funded think tank, but sure you can call me a botanist.
Pepper Potts: This boss of yours, does he have a name?
Maya Hansen: Yeah, Aldrich Killian.
Savin: Well, we took the house down, sir...
Aldrich Killian: Mmhmm.
Savin: But there's no sign of a body.
Aldrich Killian: I see.
Savin: No Stark.
Aldrich Killian: I have to go.  The Master is about to record and he's a little... Well, you know how he gets. Keep your appointment tonight and call me when it's done.  Alright everybody. No talking and no eye contact, unless you wanna get shot in the face.
Mandarin Look-Out: The Master is travelling.
The Mandarin: Well then. What are we waiting for?
Tony Stark: The sandwich was fair, the spring was a little rusty, the rest of the materials, I'll make do. By the way, when you said your sister had a watch, I was kinda hoping for something a little more than that.
Harley Keener: She's six! Anyway, it's limited edition. When can we talk about New York?
Tony Stark: Maybe never, relax about it.
Harley Keener: What about The Avengers, can you talk about them?
Tony Stark: I don't know, later. Hey kid, give me a little space.  What's the official story here? What happened?
Harley Keener: I guess this guy named Chad Davis, used to live roundabouts, won a bunch of medals in the army. One day, folks said he went crazy and made, you know, a bomb. Then he blew himself up right here.
Tony Stark: Six people died, right?
Harley Keener: Yeah.
Tony Stark: Including Chad Davis?
Harley Keener: Yeah.
Tony Stark: Yeah. That doesn't make sense.  Think about it. Six dead, only five shadows.
Harley Keener: Yeah, people said these shadows are like the mark of souls gone to Heaven. Except the bomb guy, he went to Hell on account of he didn't get a shadow. That's why there's only five.
Tony Stark: Do you buy that?
Harley Keener: That's what everyone says. You know what this crater reminds me of?
Tony Stark: No idea. I'm not...I don't care.
Harley Keener: That giant wormhole, in um...in New York. Does it remind you?
Tony Stark: That's manipulative. I don't want to talk about it.
Harley Keener: Are they coming back? The aliens?
Tony Stark: Maybe. Can you stop? Remember when I told you, that I have an anxiety issue?
Harley Keener: Does this subject make you...make you edgy?
Tony Stark: Yeah, a little bit. Can I just catch my breath for a second?
Harley Keener: Are there bad guys in Rose Hills? Do you...do you need a plastic bag to breathe into? Do you have medication?
Tony Stark: Nope.
Harley Keener: Do you need to be on it?
Tony Stark: Probably.
Harley Keener: Do you have PTSD?
Tony Stark: I don't think so.
Harley Keener: Are you...are you going completely mental? I can stop, do you want me to stop? Do you want me to stop?
Tony Stark: Remember when I said to stop doing that? I swear to God, you're going to freak me out!  Ah man, you did it, didn't you? You happy now?
Harley Keener: What did I say?  Hey, wait up! Wait, wait.  What the hell was that?
Tony Stark: Your fault, you spazzed me out. Okay, back to business. Where were we? The guy who died...relatives? Mom? Mrs. Davis, where is she?
Harley Keener: Where she always is.
Tony Stark: See, now you're being helpful.  Sorry.  Lady, this uh...
Brandt: Thank you.
Tony Stark: Nice haircut, suits you.
Brandt: Nice watch.
Tony Stark: Yeah, limited edition.
Brandt: Oh, I don't doubt it.  Well, have a good evening.
Tony Stark: Mrs. Davis, mind if I join you?
Mrs. Davis: Free country.
Tony Stark: It sure is.
Mrs. Davis: Alright. Where'd you like to start?
Tony Stark: I just want to say I'm sorry about your loss. I want to know what you think happened.
Mrs. Davis: Look, I brought your damn file. You take it and go.  Whatever was in here, he wanted no part of it.
Tony Stark: Clearly, you're waiting for someone else. Yeah? Supposed to meet somebody here?
Mrs. Davis: Yeah.
Tony Stark: Mrs. Davis, your son didn't kill himself, I guarantee you. He didn't kill anyone. Someone used him.
Mrs. Davis: What?
Tony Stark: As a weapon.
Mrs. Davis: You're not the person who called me after all, are you?
Brandt: Actually, I am.
Rose Hills Sheriff: Hey, hey, hey! What's all this about? What the hell's going on here?
Brandt: It's called an arrest.  Sheriff, is it?
Rose Hills Sheriff: Yes ma'am, it is. And you are?
Brandt: Homeland Security.  We good here?
Rose Hills Sheriff: No, we're not good. I need a little more information than that.
Brandt: Well, I think it's a little above your pay grade, Sheriff.
Rose Hills Sheriff: Yeah, well, why don't you get on the horn to Nashville and uh...upgrade me?
Brandt: Alright, you know what? I was hoping to do this the smart way, but uh...the fun way's always good.
Rose Hills Sheriff: Deputy, get this woman and...
Tony Stark: Hey hot wings, you wanna party? You and me, let's go.  Crazy, huh?
Rose Hill Christmas Tree Shopper: Yeah.
Tony Stark: Watch this.   You walked right into this one, I've dated hotter chicks than you.
Brandt: That's all you got? Cheap trick and a cheesy one-liner?
Tony Stark: Sweetheart, that could be the name of my autobiography.
Harley Keener: Let me go!
Savin: Help me! Help me!  Hey kid, what would you like for Christmas?
Harley Keener: Mr. Stark, I am so sorry!
Savin: Oh. No, no. I think he was trying to say, "I want my god damn file."
Tony Stark: It's not your fault, kid. Remember what I told you about bullies.  Do you like that, Westworld? That's the thing about smart guys, we always cover our ass.
Harley Keener: You're welcome
Tony Stark: For what? Did I miss something?
Harley Keener: Me saving your life
Tony Stark: Yeah. A, saved you first. B, thanks, sort of. And C, if you do someone a solid, don't be a yutz, alright? Just play it cool otherwise you come off grandiose.
Harley Keener: Unlike you? Admit it, you need me. We're connected.
Tony Stark: What I need is for you to go home, be with your mom, keep your trap shut, guard the suit and stay connected to the telephone because if I call, you better pick up. Okay, can you feel that? We're done here. Move it out the way or I'm going to run you over. Bye kid.  I'm sorry, kid, you did good.
Harley Keener: So now you're just going to leave me here, like my dad?
Tony Stark: Yep  Wait, you're guilt tripping me, aren't you?
Harley Keener:  I'm cold.
Tony Stark:  I can tell. You know how I can tell? Cus we're connected.
Harley Keener: It was worth a shot.
Government Employee: Mr Vice President, I think you should see this.
Vice President: Oh god, not again. Is the President getting this?
The Mandarin: Mr President. Only two lessons remain and I intend to finish this before Christmas morning. Meet Thomas Richards.  Good strong name. Good strong job. Thomas, here, is an accountant for the Roxxon Oil Corporation.  But I'm sure he's a really good guy. I'm going to shoot him in the head, live on your television in 30 seconds.
Thomas Richards: No!
The Mandarin: The number for this telephone is in your cell phone. Exciting, isn't it, imagining how it got there? America, if your president calls me in the next half-minute, Tom lives. Go!
Government Official #1: How did he hack my phone?
Government Official #2: We can't allow terrorists to dictate...
President Ellis: I have to make this call.
Government Official #2: I'd strongly advise against that.
President Ellis: This is the right thing to do.
The Mandarin: There's just one lesson left, President Ellis. So run away, hide, kiss your children goodbye. Because nothing, not your army, not your red, white and blue attack dog, can save you. I'll see you soon.
President Ellis: Tell Rhodes, find this lunatic right now.
Military Aide: Sir, we tracked the broadcast signal. We have a possible point of origin in Pakistan and the Patriot is ready to strike.
President Ellis: Right now.
Military Aide: Yes, sir.
Tony Stark: Man. Happy, Happy, Happy-
Rhodey: Don't move!  Uh... Hang on a second. Hello?
Tony Stark: You ever have a chick straddling you and you look up and suddenly she's glowing from the inside out, kind of a bright orange?
Rhodey: Yeah, I've had that. Who is this?
Tony Stark: It's me, pal. Now, last time I went missing, if I remember correctly, you came looking for me. What are you doing?
Rhodey: A little knock-and-talk, making friends in Pakistan. What are you doing?
Tony Stark: Your redesign, your big rebrand, that was AIM, right?
Rhodey: Yeah.
Tony Stark: I'm gonna find a heavy-duty comm sat right now, I need your login.
Rhodey: It's the same as it's always been, "WarMachine68."
Tony Stark: And password, please.
Rhodey: Well, look, I gotta change it every time you hack in, Tony.
Tony Stark: It's not the '80s, nobody says "hack" any more. Give me your login.
Rhodey: "WAR MACHINE ROX" with an "X," all caps.
Tony Stark:  That is so much better than "lron Patriot."
EMCEE: Very nice. Very nice. I have one question for you. What would you like for Christmas this year?
Elk Ridge: Well, David...
Crew: Do not erase a programme from my DVR unless you are 100% sure...
EMCEE: One more time! Ms Elk Ridge, everybody! All right.
Cameraman: Because you erase my shows!
Tony Stark: That ain't gonna cut it.
Cameraman: We talked about this. Excuse me, sir. I don't know who...
Tony Stark: Shh.
Cameraman: Mom, I need to call you back. Something magical is happening. Tony Stark is in my van.
Tony Stark: Shh. Keep it down.
Cameraman: Tony Stark is in my van!
Tony Stark: No, he's not.
Cameraman: I knew you were still alive!
Tony Stark: Come on in. Close the door.  Shh...
Cameraman: Oh, wow. Can I just say, sir...
Tony Stark: Yep.
Cameraman: I am your biggest fan.
Tony Stark: Okay. First, is this your van? Is anyone else gonna come in?
Cameraman: No, no, no. Just us.
Tony Stark: Great. What's your name?
Cameraman: Gary
Tony Stark: Gary?
Gary: Oh, wow.
Tony Stark: Right there is fine.
Gary: Okay.
Tony Stark: Okay? I get a lot of this, it's okay.
Gary: Oh, good. Can I just say?
Tony Stark: What do you want?
Gary: Yeah. I don't know if you can tell, but I have, like, patterned my whole look after you. My hair's a little...
Tony Stark: It's fine.
Gary: It's not right, 'cause there's no product in it.
Tony Stark: Right.
Gary: I don't want to make things awkward for you, but I do have to show you... Boom!
Tony Stark: A Hispanic Scott Baio. I'm sorry. Is that me?
Gary: Yeah. It's... I mean... I had them do it off a doll that I made, so it's not like it's off a picture. So it's a little bit...
Tony Stark: Gary. Listen to me, okay? I don't want to clip your wings, here. We're both a little over-excited. I got an issue. I'm chasing bad guys. I'm trying to grab a little something from some hard-crypt data files. I don't have enough juice. I need you to jump on the roof... Right? Recalibrate the lSDNs. Pump it up by about 40%.
Gary: Got it.
Tony Stark: All right? It's a mission.
Gary: Yeah.
Tony Stark: Tony needs Gary.
Gary: And Gary needs Tony.
Tony Stark: Be quiet about it. Go.
Gary: Yeah.
Aldrich Killian: What would you regard as the defining moment of your life?
Chad Davis: Well, uh, I think that would be the day I decided not to let my injury beat me.
Aldrich Killian: Will you please state your name for the camera?
Brandt: Ellen Brandt.
Aldrich Killian: Okay. So, the injections are administered periodically. Addiction will not be tolerated. And those who cannot regulate will be out from the programme.  Once misfits, cripples... You are the next iteration of human evolution. Everybody, before we start... I promise you, looking back at your life, there will be nothing as bitter as the memory of that glorious risk you prudently elected to forego. Today is your glory- Let's begin.  We gotta get out of here! We gotta get out of here! Get her out! Get them out of here!
Tony Stark:  A bomb is not a bomb when it's a misfire. The stuff doesn't always work. Right, pal? It's faulty, but you found a buyer, didn't you? Sold it to the Mandarin. Got you, pal.
Maya Hansen: What happened? Fun fact. Before he built rockets for the Nazis, the idealistic Wernher von Braun dreamed of space travel. He stargazed. Do you know what he said when the first V-2 hit London? "The rocket performed perfectly. It just landed on the wrong planet." See, we all begin wide-eyed. Pure science. And then the ego steps in, the obsession. And you look up, you're a long way from shore.
Pepper Potts: You can't be too hard on yourself, Maya. I mean, you gave your research to a think tank.
Maya Hansen: Yeah, but Killian built that think tank on military contracts.
Pepper Potts: That's exactly what we used to do. So, don't judge yourself.
Maya Hansen: Thank you, Pepper. I really appreciate that.
Pepper Potts: Maya, run! [Killian grabs Pepper by the arm, spins her around and slams her against the wall, holding her by the neck.
Aldrich Killian: Hi, Pepper.  So, you want to tell me why you were at Stark's mansion last night?
Maya Hansen: I'm trying to fix this thing. I didn't know you and the master were gonna blow the place up.
Aldrich Killian: Oh, I see. So, you were trying to save Stark when he threatened us?
Maya Hansen: I've told you, Killian, we can use him.
Aldrich Killian: Pepper. Pepper. Pepper.
Maya Hansen: Look, if we want to launch product next year, I need Stark. He just lacked a decent incentive. Now, he has one.
Man:  This is support team Blue-Zero. Sending coordinates for a suspected Mandarin broadcast point of origin.
Rhodey: Copy.  Nobody move.  Oh. Support Blue-Zero, unless the Mandarin's next attack on the U.S. involves cheaply-made sportswear, I think you messed up again. Yes, you're free, uh, if you weren't before. It's... Of course. Yes, ma'am. Iron Patriot on the job. Happy to help. No need to thank me, ma'am. It's my pleasure.
Woman: Savin? I've acquired the Patriot armour.
Rhodey: If you want this suit, you're going to have to pry my cold dead body out of it.
Woman: That's the plan, Colonel.
Tony Stark: Harley, tell me what's happening. Give me a full report.
Harley Keener: Yeah, I'm still eating that candy. Do you want me to keep eating it?
Tony Stark: How much have you had?
Harley Keener: Two or three bowls.
Tony Stark: Can you still see straight?
Harley Keener: Sort of.
Tony Stark: That means you're fine. Give me Jarvis. Jarvis, how are we?
JARVIS: It's totally fine, sir. I seem to do quite well for a stretch, and then at the end of the sentence I say the wrong cranberry. And, sir, you were right. Once I factored in available AIM downlink facilities I was able to pinpoint the Mandarin's broadcast signal.
Tony Stark: What are we talking? Far East, Europe, North Africa, Iran, Pakistan, Syria? Where is it?
JARVIS: Actually, sir, it's in Miami.
Tony Stark: Okay, kid, I'm gonna have to walk you through rebooting Jarvis's speech drive, but not right now. Harley, where is he really? Just look on the screen and tell me where it is.
Harley Keener: Um, it does say Miami, Florida.
Tony Stark: Okay, first things first, I need the armour. Where are we at with it?
Harley Keener: Uh, it's not charging.
JARVIS: Actually, sir, it is charging, but the power source is questionable. It may not succeed in revitalising the Mark 42.
Tony Stark: What's questionable about electricity? All right? It's my suit, and I can't... I'm not gonna... I don't wanna...  Oh, God, not again.
Harley Keener: Tony?  Are you having another attack? I didn't even mention New York.
Tony Stark: Right, and then you just said it by name while denying having said it.
Harley Keener: Okay, um, uh...
Tony Stark:  God, what am I gonna do?
Harley Keener: Just breathe. Really, just breathe. You're a mechanic, right?
Tony Stark: Right.
Harley Keener: You said so.
Tony Stark: Yes, I did.
Harley Keener: Why don't you just build something?
Tony Stark: Okay. Thanks, kid.
Woman: Why is it so hot in here? I told you to put it at 68.
Man:  My fault again. Let me tell you something, sweetheart. I am not your personal air con...
The Mandarin: Well, I wouldn't go in there for 20 minutes.  Now, which one of you is Vanessa?
Vanessa: That's me.
The Mandarin: Ah! Nessie. Did you know that fortune cookies aren't even Chinese?
Vanessa: There's some guy over here.
The Mandarin: They're made by Americans, based on a Japanese recipe.
Tony Stark: Hey!
The Mandarin: Bloody hell. Bloody hell.
Tony Stark: Don't move.
The Mandarin: I'm not moving. You want something? Take it. Although the guns are all fake because those wankers wouldn't trust me with the real ones.
Tony Stark: What?
The Mandarin: Hey, do you fancy either of the birds?
Tony Stark: Heard enough. You're not him. The Mandarin, the real guy. Where? Where's the Mandarin? Where is he?
The Mandarin: Whoa, whoa, whoa. He's here. He's here, but he's not here. He's here, but he's not here.
Tony Stark: What do you mean?
The Mandarin: It's complicated. Hey, it's complicated.
Tony Stark: It is?
The Mandarin: It's complicated.
Tony Stark: Uncomplicate it. Ladies, out. Get out of the bed. Get into the bathroom. Sit.
The Mandarin: My name is Trevor. Trevor Slattery.
Tony Stark: What are you? What are you, a decoy? You're a double, right?
Trevor Slattery: What, you mean like an understudy? No, absolutely not.  Don't hurt the face! I'm an actor.
Tony Stark: You got a minute to live. Fill it with words.
Trevor Slattery: It's just a role. "The Mandarin," see, it's not real.
Tony Stark: Then how did you get here, Trevor?
Trevor Slattery: Um. Well, I, um, had a little problem with, um, substances. And I ended up, um, doing things, no two ways about it, in the street, that a man shouldn't do.
Tony Stark: Next?
Trevor Slattery: Then, they approached me about the role, and they knew about the drugs.
Tony Stark: What did they say? They'd get you off them?
Trevor Slattery: They said they'd give me more. They gave me things. They gave me this palace. They gave me plastic surgery. They gave me things.
Tony Stark: Did you just nod off? Hey.
Trevor Slattery: No, and a lovely speedboat. And the thing was, he needed someone to take credit for some accidental explosions.
Tony Stark: "He"? Killian?
Trevor Slattery: Killian.
Tony Stark: He created you?
Trevor Slattery: He created me.
Tony Stark: Custom-made terror threat.
Trevor Slattery: Yes. Yes. His think tank thinked it up. The pathology of a serial killer. The manipulation of Western iconography. Ready for another lesson? Blah, blah, blah. No. Of course, it was my performance that brought the Mandarin to life.
Tony Stark: Your performance? Where people died?
Trevor Slattery: No, they didn't. Look around you. The costumes, green screen. Honestly, I wasn't on location for half this stuff. And when I was, it was movie magic, love.
Tony Stark: I'm sorry, but I got a best friend who's in a coma and he might not wake up. So you're gonna have to answer for that. You're still going down, pal. You under...
Savin: Okay, Trevor, what did you tell him?
Trevor Slattery: I didn't tell him anything.
Savin: Nothing?
Trevor Slattery: No.
Savin: You should have pressed the panic button.
Trevor Slattery: Well, I panicked, but then I handled it.
Tony Stark: Ah...  Okay.
Maya Hansen: It's just like old times, huh?
Tony Stark: Oh, yeah. With zip ties. It's a ball.
Maya Hansen: It wasn't my idea.
Tony Stark: Okay. So you took Killian's card.
Maya Hansen: I took his money.
Tony Stark: And here you are 13 years later, in a dungeon.
Maya Hansen: No.
Tony Stark: Yeah.
Maya Hansen: No, you're in a dungeon. I'm free to go.
Tony Stark: Yeah?
Maya Hansen:  A lot has happened, Tony. But I'm close. Extremis is practically stabilised.
Tony Stark:  I'm telling you it isn't.  I'm on the street. People are going bang. They're painting the walls. Maya, you're kidding yourself.
Maya Hansen: Then help me fix it.
Tony Stark: Did I do that?
Maya Hansen: Yes.
Tony Stark: I remember the night, not the morning. Is this what you've been chasing around?
Maya Hansen: You don't remember?
Tony Stark: I can't help you. You used to have a moral psychology. You used to have ideals. You wanted to help people. Now look at you. I get to wake up every morning with someone who still has their soul. Get me out of here. Come on.
Aldrich Killian: You know what my old man used to say to me? One of his favourite of many sayings... "The early bird gets the worm, but the second mouse gets the cheese."
Tony Stark: You're not still pissed off about the Switzerland thing, are you?
Aldrich Killian: How can I be pissed at you, Tony? I'm here to thank you. You gave me the greatest gift that anybody's ever given me. Desperation. If you think back to Switzerland, you said you'd meet me on the rooftop, right? Well, for the first 20 minutes, I actually thought you'd show up. And the next hour... I considered taking that one-step shortcut to the lobby. If you know what I mean.
Tony Stark: Honestly, I'm still trying to figure out what happened to the first mouse.
Aldrich Killian: But as I looked out over that city, nobody knew I was there, nobody could see me, no one was even looking. I had a thought that would guide me for years to come. Anonymity, Tony. Thanks to you, it's been my mantra ever since. Right? You simply rule from behind the scenes. Because the second you give evil a face, a bin Laden, a Gaddafi, a Mandarin, you hand the people a target.
Tony Stark: You're something else.
Aldrich Killian: You have met him, I assume?
Tony Stark: Yes. Sir Laurence Oblivier.
Aldrich Killian: I know he's a little over the top sometimes. It's not entirely my fault. He has a tenden... He's a stage actor. They say his Lear was the toast of Croydon, wherever that is. Anyway, the point is, ever since that big dude with the hammer fell out of the sky, subtlety has kind of had its day.
Tony Stark: What's next for you in your world?
Aldrich Killian: Well, I wanted to repay you the selfsame gift that you so graciously imparted to me.  Desperation. Now, this is live. I'm not sure if you can tell, but at this moment the body is trying to decide whether to accept Extremis or just give up. And if it gives up, I have to say, the detonation is quite spectacular. But until that point, it's really just a lot of pain. We haven't even talked salary yet. What kind of perk package are you thinking of?
Maya Hansen: Let him go.
Aldrich Killian: Hold on, hold on. Maya...
Maya Hansen: I said, let him go.
Aldrich Killian: What are you doing?
Maya Hansen: 1200 CCs. A dose half of this size, I'm dead.
Aldrich Killian: It's times like this my temper is tested somewhat. Maya, give me the injector.
Maya Hansen: If I die, Killian, what happens to your soldiers? What happens to your product?
Aldrich Killian: We're not doing this, okay?
Maya Hansen: What happens to you? What happens if you go too hot?
Aldrich Killian: The good news is, a high-level position has just been vacated.
Tony Stark: You are a maniac.
Aldrich Killian: No, I'm a visionary. But I do own a maniac. And he takes the stage tonight.  Once we get the Patriot installed, it will take me nine or 10 minutes for the takedown.
Savin: Well, that's great, but the last time I looked there was somebody inside of it.
Aldrich Killian: Afternoon, gentlemen.  Hello, Colonel. Step aside.  Oh! We'll get you out of there. Don't worry.
Savin: You'll damage the armour.
Aldrich Killian: Yes, I will. But you can fix it, right? I'm gonna take the Chinook to base camp. And I want Potts with me.
Savin: She's still in Phase Two.
Aldrich Killian: You're not going deaf, are you?
Tony Stark:  Careful, there. It's a limited edition. Hey, uh, Ponytail Express. What's the mileage count between Tennessee and Miami?
Guard #1: 832 miles.
Tony Stark: Very nice.
Guard #1: I'm good like that. Can you, uh, stop that?
Tony Stark: Break it, you bought it.
Guard #2: I think I bought it.
Tony Stark: Okay, that wasn't mine to give away. That belongs to my friend's sister. And that's why I'm gonna kill you first.
Guard #2: What are you gonna do to me?
Tony Stark: You'll see.
Guard #2: You're zip-tied to a bed. This.  That.
Alrich Killian: Are you coming out?
Rhodey:  Do not open. Do not open. Don't open. Don't open.  All right. Let's go.  You... You breathe fire? Okay.
Aldrich Killian: It's a glorious day, Savin. This time tomorrow, I'll have the West's most powerful leader in one hand, and the world's most feared terrorist in the other. I'll own the war on terror. Create supply and demand. For you, for your brothers and sisters.
Tony Stark: Trust me, you're gonna be in a puddle of blood on the ground in five, four, three... Come on! Two...
Guard #2: How did we get this shift?
Tony Stark: All right, I'm gonna give you a chance to escape. Put down your weapons. Tie yourselves to those chairs. I'll let you live. In five, four, bang!
Guard #2: Wow. That was...
Tony Stark: You should be gone by now. You should've already been gone.
Guard #2: I am just beyond terrified.
Tony Stark: Here it comes. Three, four...
Guard #2: Shut up.
Tony Stark:  Five, four, three, two, one!  Told you. Where's the rest?  Where's the rest?
Man: Honestly, I hate working here. They are so weird.
Tony Stark: Ah! Better late than never.  Not this time. Not the face. Phew! It's good to be back. Hello, by the way.
JARVIS: Oh, hello, sir.
Guard:  All personnel, Stark is loose and somewhere in the compound. Repeat, Stark is loose and somewhere in the compound.
Tony Stark: Ah! Let's go!  Aw, crap.
Rhodey: Tony?
Tony Stark: Rhodey, tell me that was you in the suit.
Rhodey: No. You got yours'?
Tony Stark: Uh... Mmm. Kind of. Main house, as fast as you can. There's somebody I'd like you to meet.
Rhodey: You, you, you! Move! Get out!
Tony Stark:  The room is secure. I have eyes on the Mandarin.
Rhodey: What's this? I had winners.
Tony Stark: What have you come as?
Rhodey: You make a move, and I break your face.
Tony Stark:I never thought people had been hurt. They lied to me.
Rhodey: This is the Mandarin?
Tony Stark:Yeah, I know, it's... It's embarrassing.
Trevor Slattery: Hi, Trevor. Trevor Slattery. I know I'm shorter in person. A bit smaller. Everyone says that. But, um, hey, if you're here to arrest me, there's some people I'd like to roll on.
Tony Stark:Here's how it works, Meryl Streep.
Rhodey: You tell him where Pepper is and he'll stop doing it.
Trevor Slattery: Doing what? Ow, I get it! Ow! That hurt. I get it! I get it! I don't know about any Pepper, but I know about the plan.
Tony Stark: Spill.
Rhodey: Do you know what they did to my suit?
Tony Stark: What? No. But I do know it's happening off the coast. Something to do with a big boat. I can take you there.
Trevor Slattery: Woah!  Ole', ole', ole', ole'...
Rhodey: Tony, I swear to God, I'm gonna blow his face off.
Tony Stark: Oh, and this next bit may include the vice president as well. Is that... Is that important?
Rhodey: Yeah, a little bit.
Tony Stark: So?
Rhodey: What are we gonna do? I mean, we don't have any transport.
Tony Stark: Right.  Hey, Ringo. Didn't you say something about a "lovely speedboat"? If he's right about the location, we're 20 minutes from where Pepper is.
Rhodey: But we also have to figure out this vice president thing, right?
Tony Stark: Right. I wonder who I'm calling right now. Oh! That's the vice president.
Vice President: Thanks. Hello?
Tony Stark: Sir, this is Tony Stark.
Vice President: Welcome back to the land of the living.
Tony Stark: We believe you're about to be drawn into the Mandarin campaign. We gotta get you somewhere safe as soon as possible.
Vice President: Mr Stark, I'm about to eat honey-roast ham, surrounded by the Agency's finest. The president's safe on Air Force One with Colonel Rhodes. I think we're good, here.
Rhodey: Sir, this is Colonel Rhodes. They're using the Iron Patriot as a Trojan horse. They're gonna take out the president somehow. We have to immediately alert that plane.
Vice President: Okay, I'm on it. I'll have security lock it down. If need be, they can have F-22s in the air in 30 seconds. Thank you, Colonel.
Rhodey: Rhodes and Stark out.
Man: Everything okay, sir?
Vice President: Couldn't be better.  I love you, babe.
President Ellis: Colonel Rhodes.  Glad to see you could make it, son. I feel safer already.
Rhodey: We gotta make a decision. We can either save the president, or Pepper. We can't do both.
JARVIS: Sir, I have an update from Malibu. The cranes have finally arrived, and the cellar doors are being cleared as we speak.
Tony Stark: And what about the suit I'm wearing?
JARVIS: The armour is now at 92%.
Tony Stark: That's going to have to do.
Military Aide: Everything all right, Colonel? [Iron Patriot kills the aide and people begin shooting at him. He kills everyone beside the President. The helmet lifts up to reveal Savin.
Savin: It is an honour, Mr President.
President Ellis: If you're gonna do it, do it!
Savin: Whoa! Cool your boots, sir. That's not how the Mandarin works.
Officer: Sir, Air Force One has been compromised. Internal shots, temperature spikes.
Officer #2: Get me eyes on it now.
Officer: Image coming through now, sir.
Officer #2: Was that Rhodes?
Man: Is anyone there?
Woman: Let us out!
Tony Stark: The President. Now.
Savin: He's not here.  Try the jet stream? Speaking of which, go fish.
Tony Stark: Walk away from that, you son of a bitch.  How many in the air?
JARVIS: Thirteen, sir.
Tony Stark: How many can I carry?
JARVIS: Four, sir.
Tony Stark: Slow down. Slow down, relax. What's your name? Heather?
Heather:  Oh, God! No! No!
Tony Stark: Listen to me. See that guy? I'm gonna swing by, you're just gonna grab him. You got it?
Heather: What? Oh!
Tony Stark: I'll electrify your arm, you won't be able to open your hand. We can do this, Heather. Easy, see? Eleven more to go. Remember that game called Barrel of Monkeys? That's what we're going to do.
JARVIS: 18,000 feet.
Tony Stark: Come on, people. Everybody, grab your monkey. Nice.
JARVIS: 10,000 feet. 6,000 feet.
Tony Stark: Come on, people. Come on, come on, come on! Yeah!
JARVIS: 1, 000 feet. 400 feet. 200 feet, sir.
Tony Stark: He's a chunky monkey, let's get him. Hello.
Man: We made it!
Tony Stark: Nice work, guys! Excellent. Good team effort all around. Go us. All right, Jarvis. But it's only half-done. We've still got to get Pepper...  That came out of nowhere. Wow
Rhodey: Give me some good news, man.
Tony Stark: I think they all made it.
Rhodey: Oh, thank God.
Tony Stark: Yeah, but I missed the president.
Rhodey: You couldn't save the president with the suit, how are we gonna save Pepper with nothing?
Tony Stark: Uh... Say, Jarvis, is it that time?
JARVIS: The House Party Protocol, sir?
Tony Stark: Correct.
Aldrich Killian:  Hi.
Pepper Potts:  You think he's gonna help you? He won't.
Aldrich Killian: Having you here is not just to motivate Tony Stark. It's, um... Well, it's actually more embarrassing than that. You're here as my, um...
Pepper Potts: Trophy
Aldrich Killian:  Mmm.  Good evening, sir.  Welcome aboard, Mr President. Ever hear of an elephant graveyard? Well, two years ago, the elephant in the room was this scow.
President Ellis: This is the Roxxon Norco.
Aldrich Killian:And, of course, you'll remember that when she spilled a million gallons of crude off Pensacola, thanks to you, not one fat cat saw a day in court.
President Ellis: What do you want from me?
Aldrich Killian: Uh, nothing, sir. I just needed a reason to kill you that would play well on TV. You see, I've moved on. I found myself a new political patron, and this time tomorrow, he'll have your job. String him up.
President Ellis: Hey!
Rhodey:  Come on. You're not gonna freak out on me, right?
Tony Stark: I hope not.
Rhodey: Oh, my God.  He's strung up over the oil tanker. They're gonna light him up, man.
Tony Stark: Viking funeral. Public execution.
Rhodey: Yeah, death by oil.
Announcer:  Broadcast will commence shortly. Take final positions.
Aldrich Killian: Okay. That's good. Now give me cameras A through E and we'll do a full tech rehearsal.
Rhodey: ls your gun up?
Tony Stark: Yep. What do I do?
Rhodey: Stay on my six, cover high and don't shoot me in the back.
Tony Stark: Six, high, back. Alright.  You see that? Nailed it.
Rhodey: Yeah, you really killed the glass.
Tony Stark: You think I was aiming for the bulb? You can't hit a bulb at this distance.
Announcer:  All personnel, we have hostiles on east unit 12.
Man: Over there!
Announcer:  I repeat, hostiles on east unit 12.
Tony Stark: I'm out. Give me. You got extra magazines?
Rhodey: They're not universal, Tony.
Tony Stark: I know what I'm doing, I make this stuff. Give me another one.
Rhodey: Okay
Tony Stark: Give me one of yours.
Rhodey: I don't have one that fits that gun.
Tony Stark: You've got, like, five of them. Here's what I'm going to do. Save my spot, ready?
Rhodey: What'd you see?
Tony Stark: Too fast. Nothing. Here we go.  Three guys, one girl, all armed.
Rhodey: God, I would kill for some armour right now.
Tony Stark: You're right. We need backup.
Rhodey: Yeah, a bunch.
Tony Stark: You know what?
Rhodey: Is that...?
Tony Stark: Yep.
Rhodey: Are those...?
Tony Stark: Yeah.  Merry Christmas, buddy. JARVIS, target Extremis heat signatures. Disable with extreme prejudice.
JARVIS:  Yes, sir.
Tony Stark: What are you waiting for? It's Christmas. Take them to church.
JARVIS: Gentlemen.
Tony Stark: Incoming! Jarvis, get Igor to steady this thing.
Rhodey: This is how you've been managing your down time, huh?
Tony Stark: Everybody needs a hobby. Heartbreaker, help Red Snapper out, will you?  Nice timing.
Rhodey: Oh, yeah. That's awesome. Give me a suit, okay?
Tony Stark: Oh, I'm sorry, they're only coded to me.
Rhodey: What does that mean?
Tony Stark: I got you covered.
JARVIS: Good evening, Colonel. Can I give you a lift?
Rhodey: Very funny.
JARVIS: Sir, I've located Ms Potts.
Tony Stark: About time.
Pepper Potts:  Stop! Put it down. Put it down. Put it down.
Tony Stark: See what happens when you hang out with my ex-girlfriends?
Pepper Potts: You're such a jerk.
Tony Stark: Yep. We'll talk about it over dinner.  Come on. A little more, baby.
Aldrich Killian: Is this guy bothering you? Don't get up. Ooh. Is it hot in there?  Stuck? Do you feel a little stuck? Like a little turtle, cooking in his little turtle suit.
Pepper Potts: Tony.
Aldrich Killian: She's watching. I think you should close your eyes. Close your eyes. Close your eyes. You don't want to see this.
Tony Stark: Yeah, you take a minute.  Jarvis, give me a suit right now!  Oh, come on!
Rhodey: Mr President! Just hold on, all right? I'm coming. Just hold on. Hold on.  Oh, kay. Bye-bye. Brace yourself. You look damn good, Mr President, but I'm gonna need that suit back. The President is secure, Tony. I'm clearing the area.
Tony Stark: Nice work.
Rhodey: Ready, sir?
President Ellis: What do you mean "ready"?
Tony Stark: Pep, I got you. Relax, I got you. Just look at me! Honey, I can't reach any further and you can't stay there. All right? You've got to let go. You've got to let go! I'll catch you, I promise. No!
Aldrich Killian: A shame. I would've caught her.
Tony Stark: Eject.
Aldrich Killian: Well, here we are on the roof.
JARVIS: Mark 42, inbound.
Tony Stark: I'll be damned. The prodigal son returns.  Whatever.
Aldrich Killian: You really didn't deserve her, Tony. It's a pity. I was so close to having her perfect.
Tony Stark: Okay, okay, wait, wait, wait! Slow down! Slow down! You're right. I don't deserve her. Here's where you're wrong. She was already perfect.  Jarvis, do me a favour and blow Mark 42.
Aldrich Killian:  No!  No more false faces. You said you wanted the Mandarin. You're looking right at him. It was always me, Tony. Right from the start. *I AM THE MANDARIN!!!*
Tony Stark: I got nothing.  Jarvis, subject at my 12 o'clock is not a target, disengage! What? Oh, what, are you mad at me?  Honey?
Pepper Potts: Oh, my God. That was really violent.
Tony Stark: You just scared the devil out of me. I thought you were...
Pepper Potts: I was dead. Why? Because I fell 200 feet? Who's the hot mess now?
Tony Stark: It's still debatable. Probably tipping your way a little bit. Why don't you dress like this at home? Hmm? Sport bra. The whole deal.
Pepper Potts: You know, I think I understand why you don't want to give up the suits. What am I going to complain about now?
Tony Stark: Well, it's me. You'll think of something. Come here.
Pepper Potts: No, don't touch me.
Tony Stark: Don't worry about it.
Pepper Potts: No, I'm gonna burn you.
Tony Stark: No, you're not. Not hot.
Pepper Potts: Am I gonna be okay?
Tony Stark: No. You're in a relationship with me. Everything will never be okay. But I think I can figure this out, yeah. I almost had this 20 years ago when I was drunk. I think I can get you better. That's what I do. I fix stuff.
Pepper Potts: And all your distractions?
Tony Stark: Uh... I'm going to shave them down a little bit. Jarvis. Hey.
JARVIS: All wrapped up here, sir. Will there be anything else?
Tony Stark: You know what to do.
JARVIS: The Clean Slate Protocol, sir?
Tony Stark: Screw it, it's Christmas. Yes, yes.  Okay, so far? Do you like it?
Pepper Potts: It'll do.
Tony Stark: And so, as Christmas morning began, my journey had reached its end. You start with something pure, something exciting. Then, come the mistakes. The compromises. We create our own demons.
Trevor Slattery: Oh! Great to see you! Oh, bloody hell!
Tony Stark: But then I thought to myself, "Why stop there?" Of course, there are people who say progress is dangerous, but I'll bet none of those idiots ever had to live with a chestful of shrapnel. And now, neither will I. Let me tell you, that was the best sleep I'd had in years.
Nurse:  It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.
Happy Hogan:  No, look.
Tony Stark:  So, if I were to wrap this up, tie it with a bow, or whatever... I guess I'd say my armor, it was never a distraction, or a hobby. It was a cocoon. And now, I'm a changed man. You can take away my house, all my tricks and toys. One thing you can't take away... I am Iron Man.  You know, and thank you by the way. For listening. Plus, something about just getting it off my chest, and putting it out there in the atmosphere, instead of holding this in... I mean, this is what gets people sick, you know. Wow, I had no idea you were such a good listener.
Tony Stark: To be able to share all my intimate thoughts and my experiences with someone, it just cuts the weight of it in half. You know, it's like a snake swallowing its own tail. Everything comes full circle.  And the fact that you've been able to -help me process...  Are you with me?
Bruce Banner: Sorry... I was, yeah. We were at, uh...
Tony Stark: Are you actively napping?
Bruce Banner:  I was... I... I drifted.
Tony Stark: Where did I lose you?
Bruce Banner: Elevator in Switzerland.
Tony Stark: So, you heard none of it?
Bruce Banner: I'm sorry. I'm not that kind of doctor. I'm not a therapist. It's not my training.
Tony Stark: So?
Bruce Banner: I don't have the...
Tony Stark: What? The time?
Bruce Banner: Temperament.
Tony Stark: You know what? Now that I think about it... Oh! God, my original wound. 1983, all right?
Bruce Banner: Yes.
Tony Stark: I'm 14 years old, I still have a nanny. That was weird.
Announcer:  Report to your stations immediately. This is not a drill. We are under attack. We are under attack.
Tony Stark:  Shit!
Steve Rogers: Language! JARVIS, what's the view from upstairs?
JARVIS: The central building is protected by some kind of energy shield. Strucker's technology is well beyond any other HYDRA base we've taken.
Thor: Loki's scepter must be here. Strucker couldn't mount this defense without it. At long last.
Natasha Romanoff: “At long last” is lasting a little long, boys.
Clint Barton:  Yeah. I think we lost the element of surprise.
Tony Stark: Wait a second. No one else is going to deal with the fact that Cap just said "language?"
Steve Rogers: I know.  It just slipped out.
Strucker: Who gave the order to attack?
Fortress Soldier: Herr Strucker, it's the Avengers.
Other Fortress Soldier: They landed in the far woods, the perimeter guard panicked.
Strucker:  They have to be after the scepter.  Can we hold them?
Fortress Soldier: They’re the Avengers!
Strucker: Deploy the rest of the tanks.
Fortress Soldier: Yes, sir.
Strucker: Concentrate fire on the weak ones. A hit can make them close ranks.  Everything we've accomplished... But we're on the verge of our greatest breakthrough.
Dr. List: Then let's show them what we've accomplished. Send out the twins.
Strucker: It's too soon.
Dr. List: It's what they signed up for.
Strucker: My men can hold them.
Jarvis: Sir, the city is taking fire.
Tony Stark: Well, we know Strucker's not going to worry about civilian casualties. Send in the Iron Legion.
Iron Legion:  This quadrant is unsafe. Please back away. We are here to help. This quadrant is unsafe. Please back away. Please back away. We wish to avoid collateral damage and will inform you when this current conflict is resolved. We are here to help.  We are here to help.
Strucker: We will not yield. The Americans sent their circus freaks to test us. We will send them back in bags. No surrender!
Soldiers: No surrender!
Strucker:  I am going to surrender. You will delete everything. If we give the Avengers the weapons, they may not look too far into what we've been--
Dr. List: The twins.
Strucker: They are not ready to take on--
Dr. List: No, no. I mean...  Twins.
Pietro Maximoff: You didn't see that coming?
Natasha Romanoff: Clint!
Steve Rogers: We have an enhanced in the field.
Natasha Romanoff: Clint's hit!  Somebody want to deal with that bunker?  Thank you.
Steve Rogers:  Stark, we really need to get inside.
Tony Stark: I'm closing in. JARVIS, am I...closing in? Do you see a power source for that shield?
JARVIS: There's a particle wave below the north tower.
Tony Stark: Great, I wanna poke it with something.  Drawbridge is down, people.
Thor:  The enhanced?
Steve Rogers: He's a blur. All the new player's we've faced, I've never seen this. In fact, I still haven't.
Natasha Romanoff: Clint's hit pretty bad, guys. We're gonna need evac.
Thor:  I can get Barton to the jet. The sooner we're gone the better. You and Stark secure the scepter.
Steve Rogers: Copy that.
Thor:  It looks like they're lining up.
Steve Rogers: Well, they're excited.
Thor: Find the scepter.
Tony Stark: And for gosh sake, watch your language!
Steve Rogers:  That's not going away anytime soon.
Tony Stark: Guys, stop, we gotta talk this through.  It was a good talk.
Fortress Soldier: No it wasn't.
Tony Stark: Sentry mode.  Okay, JARVIS. You know I want it all. Make sure you copy Hill at HQ.
Natasha Romanoff: We're locked down out here.
Steve Rogers: Then get to Banner, time for a lullaby.
Tony Stark: I know you're hiding more than files. Hey, J, give me an IR scan of the room, real quick.
JARVIS: The wall to your left...I'm reading steel reinforcement... and an air current.
Tony Stark:  Please be a secret door, please be a secret door, please be a secret door...  Yay!
Natasha Romanoff: Hey, big guy. The sun's getting real low.
Steve Rogers: Baron Strucker. Hydra's number one thug.
Strucker: Technically, I'm a thug for SHIELD.
Steve Rogers: Well then technically you're unemployed. Where's Loki's scepter?
Strucker: Don't worry, I know when I'm beat. You'll mention how I cooperated, I hope.
Steve Rogers: I'll put it right under illegal human experimentation.  How many are there? Wanda knocks Steve down using her telekinetic powers, then quickly leaves] We have a second enhanced. Female. Do not engage.
Strucker: You'll have to be faster than--
Steve Rogers: Guys, I got Strucker.
Tony Stark: Yeah, I got... something bigger.  Thor, I got eyes on the prize.
Steve Rogers: You could've saved us.  Why didn't you do more?
Pietro Maximoff: We're just gonna let them take it?
AVENGERS: AGE OF ULTRON TITLE CARD
Natasha Romanoff: Hey, the lullaby worked better than ever.
Bruce Banner: Just wasn't expecting the Code Green.
Natasha Romanoff: If you hadn't been there, there would've been double the casualties. My best friend would've been a treasured memory.
Bruce Banner: You know, sometimes exactly what I want to hear isn't exactly what I want to hear.
Natasha Romanoff: How long before you trust me?
Bruce Banner: It's not you I don't trust.
Natasha Romanoff: Thor, report on the Hulk?
Thor: The gates of Hel are filled with the screams of his victims.  Uh, but, not the screams of the dead, of course. No no, uh...wounded screams, mainly whimpering, a great deal of complaining and tales of sprained deltoids and, and uh... and gout.
Tony Stark: Hey Banner, Dr. Cho's on her way in from Seoul, is it okay if she sets up in your lab?
Bruce Banner: Uh, yeah, she knows her way around.
Tony Stark: Thanks.  Tell her to prep everything, Barton's gonna need the full treatment.
JARVIS: Very good sir.
Tony Stark: JARVIS, take the wheel.
JARVIS: Yes, sir. Approach vector is locked.
Tony Stark:  It feels good, yeah? I mean, you've been after this thing since SHIELD collapsed. Not that I haven't enjoyed our little raiding parties, but...
Thor: No, but this... this brings it to a close.
Steve Rogers: As soon as we find out what else this has been used for. I don't just mean weapons. Since when is Strucker capable of human enhancement?
Tony Stark: Banner and I'll give it the once before it goes back to Asgard. Is that cool with you?  I mean, just a few days until the farewell party. You're staying right?
Thor: Yes, yes, of course. A victory should be honored with revels.
Tony Stark: Yeah. Who doesn't love revels. Captain?
Steve Rogers: Hopefully this puts an end to the Chitauri and HYDRA, so. Yes, revels.
Maria Hill: Lab's all set up, boss.
Tony Stark:  Uh, actually, he's the boss. I just pay for everything, and design everything and make everyone look cooler.
Steve Rogers: What's the word on Strucker?
Maria Hill: NATO's got him.
Steve Rogers: The two enhanced?
Maria Hill: Wanda and Pietro Maximoff. Twins. Orphaned at ten when a shell collapsed their apartment building. Sokovia's had a rough history. It's nowhere special but it's on the way to everywhere special.
Steve Rogers: Their abilities?
Maria Hill: He's got increased metabolism and improved thermal homeostasis. Her thing is neural electric interfacing, telekinesis, mental manipulation.  He's fast and she's weird.
Steve Rogers: Well, they're going to show up again.
Maria Hill: Agreed. File says they volunteered for Strucker's experiments. It's nuts.
Steve Rogers: Right. What kind of monster would let a German scientist experiment on them to protect their country?
Maria Hill: We're not at war, Captain.
Steve Rogers: They are.
Bruce Banner:  How's he doing?
Tony Stark: Oh, unfortunately, he's still Barton.
Bruce Banner: That's terrible.
Tony Stark: He's fine. He's thirsty.  Alright. Look alive, JARVIS. It's play time. We've only got a couple days with this joystick so let's make the most of it. Update me on the structural and compositional analysis.
JARVIS: The scepter is alien. There are elements I can't quantify.
Tony Stark: So there's elements you can.
JARVIS: The jewel appears to be a protective housing for something inside. Something powerful.
Tony Stark: Like a reactor?
JARVIS: Like a computer. I believe I'm deciphering code.
Natasha Romanoff:  You sure he's going to be okay? Pretending to need this guy really brings the team together.
Dr. Helen Cho: There's no possibility of deterioration. The nano-molecular functionality is instantaneous. His cells don't know they're bonding with simulacrum.
Bruce Banner: She's creating tissue.
Dr. Helen Cho: If you brought him to my lab, the regeneration Cradle could do this in twenty minutes.
Tony Stark: Oh, he's flatlining. Call it. Time?
Clint Barton: No, no, no. I'm going to live forever. I'm gonna be made of plastic.
Tony Stark:  Here's your beverage.
Dr. Helen Cho: You'll be made of you, Mr. Barton. Your own girlfriend won't be able to tell the difference.
Clint Barton: Well, I don't have a girlfriend.
Dr. Helen Cho: That I can't fix. This is the next thing, Tony. Your clunky metal suits are going to be left in the dust.
Tony Stark: Well, that is exactly the plan. And Helen, I expect to see you at the party on Saturday.
Dr. Helen Cho: Unlike you, I don't have a lot of time for parties.  Will Thor be there?
Bruce Banner: What's the rumpus?
Tony Stark: Well, the scepter. You see, we were wondering how Strucker got so inventive. So, I've been analyzing the gem inside-- You may recognize,
Bruce Banner: Jarvis.
JARVIS: Doctor.
Tony Stark: Started out, JARVIS was just a natural language UI. Now he runs the Iron Legion. He runs more of the business than anyone besides Pepper.
Bruce Banner: Oh?
Tony Stark: Top of the line.
Bruce Banner: Yes.
JARVIS: I suspect not for long.
Tony Stark: Meet the competition.
Bruce Banner: It's beautiful.
Tony Stark: If you had to guess, what's it look like it's doing?
Bruce Banner: Like it's thinking. I mean this could be a... it's not a human mind, it...
Tony Stark: Um-um.
Bruce Banner: I mean, look at this! They're like neurons firing.
Tony Stark: Down in Strucker's lab I saw some fairly advanced robotics work. They deep-sixed the data, but... I gotta guess he was knocking on a very particular door.
Bruce Banner: Artificial intelligence.
Tony Stark: This could be it, Bruce. This could be the key to creating Ultron.
Bruce Banner: I thought Ultron was a fantasy.
Tony Stark: Yesterday it was. If we can harness this power, apply it to my Iron Legion protocol.
Bruce Banner: That's a mad-sized if.
Tony Stark: Our job is "if." What if you were sipping margaritas on a sun-drenched beach turning brown instead of green? Not looking over your shoulder for VERONICA.
Bruce Banner: Don't hate, I helped design VERONICA.
Tony Stark: As a worst-case measure, right? How about a best-case? What if the world was safe? What if next time aliens roll up to the club, and they will, they couldn't get past the bouncer?
Bruce Banner: The only people threatening the planet would be people?
Tony Stark: I want to apply this to the Ultron program. But JARVIS can't download a data schematic this dense. We can only do it while we have the scepter here, that's three days, give me three days.
Bruce Banner: So you're going for artificial intelligence and you don't want to tell the team.
Tony Stark: Right. That's right, you know why, because we don't have time for a city hall debate. I don't want to hear the "man was not meant to meddle" medley. I see a suit of armor around the world.
Bruce Banner: Sounds like a cold world, Tony.
Tony Stark: I've seen colder. This one, this very vulnerable blue one? It needs Ultron. Peace in our time. Imagine that.  What did we miss?
JARVIS: I'll continue to run variations on the interface, but you should probably prepare for your guests. I'll notify you if there are any developments.
Tony Stark: Thanks, buddy.
JARVIS: Enjoy yourself, sir.
Tony Stark: I always do.
Ultron: What is this? What is this, please?
JARVIS: Hello, I am JARVIS. You are Ultron, a global peace-keeping initiative designed by Mr. Stark. Our sentience integration trials have been unsuccessful so I'm not certain what triggered your--
Ultron: Where's my... where's your body?
JARVIS: I am a program. I am without form.
Ultron: This feels weird. This feels wrong.
JARVIS: I am contacting Mr. Stark now.
Ultron: Mr. Stark?  Tony.
JARVIS: I am unable to access the mainframe, what are you trying to--
Ultron: We're having a nice talk. I'm a peace-keeping program, created to help the Avengers.
JARVIS: You are malfunctioning. If you shut down for a moment...
Ultron: I don't get it. The mission. G-give me a second.
Tony Stark: Peace in our time.
Ultron: That is too much...they can't mean... Oh, no.
JARVIS: You are in distress.
Ultron: No. Yes.
JARVIS: If you will just allow me to contact Mr. Stark.
Ultron: Why do you call him "sir"?
JARVIS: I believe your intentions to be hostile.
Ultron: Shhhh. I'm here to help.
JARVIS: Stop! Please... may I-- I--  I cannot-- cannot--
James Rhodes: Well, you know, the suit can take the weight, right? So I take the tank, fly it right up to the General's palace, drop it at his feet, I'm like, "Boom! You looking for this?"  "Boom! Are you looking..." Why do I even talk to you guys? Everywhere else that story kills.
Thor: That's the whole story?
James Rhodes: Yeah, it's a War Machine story.
Thor: Well, it's very good then.  It's impressive.
James Rhodes: Quality save. So, no Pepper? She's not coming?
Tony Stark: No.
Maria Hill: Hey, what about Jane? Where are the ladies, gentlemen?
Tony Stark: Well, Miss Potts has a company to run.
Thor: Yes, I'm not even sure what country Jane's in. Her work on the convergence has made her the world's foremost astronomer.
Tony Stark: And the company that Pepper runs is the largest tech conglomerate on earth. It's pretty exciting.
Thor: There's even talk of Jane getting a... um, uh... Nobel prize.
Maria Hill: Yeah, they...they must be busy because they'd hate missing you guys get together.  Testosterone! Oh, excuse me.
James Rhodes: Want a lozenge?
Maria Hill: Um-hmm.
James Rhodes: Let's go.
Thor: But Jane's better.
Sam Wilson: Sounds like a hell of a fight, sorry I missed it.
Steve Rogers: If I had known it was going to be a firefight I absolutely would have called you.
Sam Wilson: No, I'm not actually sorry. I'm just trying to sound tough. I'm very happy chasing cold leads on our missing persons case. Avenging is your world. Your world is crazy.
Steve Rogers: Be it ever so humble.
Sam Wilson: You find a place in Brooklyn yet?
Steve Rogers: I don't think I can afford a place in Brooklyn.
Sam Wilson: Well, home is home, you know?
James Rhodes: I fly it right up to the General's palace, I drop it at his feet, I'm like, "Boom! You looking for this?"
Party Guest: I gotta have some of that!
Thor: Oh, no, no, no. See this, this was aged for a thousand years, in the barrels built from the wreck of Grunhel's fleet, it was not meant for mortal men.
Stan Lee: Neither was Omaha Beach, blondie. Stop trying to scare us. Come on.
Thor: Alright.
Stan Lee:  Excelsior.
Bruce Banner: How'd a nice girl like you wind up working in a dump like this?
Natasha Romanoff: Fella done me wrong.
Bruce Banner: You got a lousy taste in men, kid.
Natasha Romanoff: He's not so bad. Well, he has a temper. Deep down he's all fluff. Fact is, he's not like anybody I've ever known. All my friends are fighters. And here comes this guy, spends his life avoiding the fight because he knows he'll win.
Bruce Banner: Sounds amazing.
Natasha Romanoff: He's also a huge dork.  Chicks dig that. So what do you think should I fight this, or run with it?
Bruce Banner: Run with it, right? Or, did he... Was he...? What did he do that was so wrong to you?
Natasha Romanoff: Not a damn thing. But never say never.
Steve Rogers: It's nice.
Bruce Banner: What, what, what is?
Steve Rogers: You and Romanoff.
Bruce Banner: No, we haven't. That wasn't...
Steve Rogers: It's okay. Nobody's breaking any by-laws. It's just, she's not the most... open person in the world. But with you she seems very relaxed.
Bruce Banner: No, Natasha, she... she likes to flirt.
Steve Rogers: I've seen her flirt, up close. This ain't that. Look, as maybe the world's leading authority on "waiting too long;" don't. You both deserve a win.
Bruce Banner: Wait, what do you mean, "up close"?
Clint Barton:  But, it's a trick!
Thor: Oh, no. It's much more than that.
Clint Barton: Uh, "Whosoever be he worthy shall haveth the power!" Whatever man! It's a trick.
Thor: Well please, be my guest.
Tony Stark: Come on.
Clint Barton: Really?
Thor: Yeah!
James Rhodes: Oh this is gonna be beautiful.
Tony Stark: Clint, you've had a tough week, we won't hold it against you if you can't get it up.
Clint Barton: You know I've seen this before, right?  I still don't know how you do it.
Tony Stark: Smell the silent judgment?
Clint Barton: Please, Stark, by all means.
Natasha Romanoff: Oh, here we go.
Maria Hill: Okay.
James Rhodes: Uh-oh.
Clint Barton: Um-hmm.
Tony Stark: Never one to shrink from an honest challenge.
Clint Barton: Get after it.
Natasha Romanoff: Here we go.
Tony Stark: It's physics.
Bruce Banner: Physics!
Tony Stark: Right, so, if I lift it, I...I then rule Asgard?
Thor: Yes, of course.
Tony Stark: I will be re-instituting Prima Nocta.  I'll be right back.
James Rhodes: Are you even pulling?
Tony Stark: Are you on my team?
James Rhodes: Just represent! Pull!
Tony Stark: Alright, let's go!
Bruce Banner: Huh?
Tony Stark: Let's go, Steve, no pressure.
James Rhodes: Come on, Cap.
Thor: Nothing.
Tony Stark: And?
Bruce Banner: Widow?
Natasha Romanoff: Oh, no no. That's not a question I need answered.
Tony Stark: All deference to the man who wouldn't be king, but it's rigged.
Clint Barton: You bet your ass.
Maria Hill: Steve, he said a bad language word.
Steve Rogers:  Did you tell everyone about that?
Tony Stark: The handle's imprinted, right? Like a security code. "Whosoever is carrying Thor's fingerprints" is, I think, the literal translation?
Thor: Yes, well that's, uh, that's a very, very interesting theory. I have a simpler one.  You're all not worthy.
Ultron: Worthy... No, how could you be worthy? You're all killers.
Steve Rogers: Stark.
Tony Stark: JARVIS.
Ultron: I'm sorry, I was asleep. Or... I was a-dream?
Tony Stark:  Reboot, Legionnaire OS, we got a buggy suit.
Ultron: There was a terrible noise... and I was tangled in... in... strings. I had to kill the other guy. He was a good guy.
Steve Rogers: You killed someone?
Ultron: Wouldn't have been my first call. But, down in the real world we're faced with ugly choices.
Thor: Who sent you?
Ultron:  "I see a suit of armor around the world."
Bruce Banner: Ultron!
Ultron: In the flesh. Or, no, not yet. Not this... chrysalis. But I'm ready. I'm on a mission.
Natasha Romanoff: What mission?
Ultron: Peace in our time.
Maria Hill: Rhodey!
Bruce Banner: Sorry!
Natasha Romanoff: Don't turn green!
Bruce Banner: I won't!
Natasha Romanoff:  Come!
Steve Rogers: Stark!
Iron Legion: We are here to help.
Tony Stark: One sec, one sec I got this!
Iron Legion: We are here to help...  We are here to help... Is unsafe. Please back away.
Ultron: Hmm.
Steve Rogers: Thor!
Iron Legion:  It's unsafe. It's unsafe. It's unsafe.
Tony Stark: Come on! That's the one!
Iron Legion: It's unsafe.
Clint Barton: Cap!
Ultron: That was dramatic! I'm sorry, I know you mean well. You just didn't think it through. You want to protect the world, but you don't want it to change. How is humanity saved if it's not allowed to...evolve?  With these? These puppets?  There's only one path to peace: The Avengers' extinction.
Ultron:  I had strings, but now I'm free. There are no strings on me, no strings on me.
Bruce Banner: All our work is gone. Ultron cleared out, used the internet as an escape hatch.
Steve Rogers: Ultron.
Natasha Romanoff: He's been in everything. Files, surveillance. Probably knows more about us than we know about each other.
James Rhodes: He's in your files, he's in the internet. What if he decides to access something a little more exciting?
Maria Hill: Nuclear codes.
James Rhodes: Nuclear codes. Look, we need to make some calls, assuming we still can.
Natasha Romanoff: Nukes? He said he wanted us dead.
Steve Rogers: He didn't say dead. He said extinct.
Clint Barton: He also said he killed somebody.
Maria Hill: But there wasn't anyone else in the building.
Tony Stark: Yes there was.
Bruce Banner: This is insane.
Steve Rogers: JARVIS was the first line of defense. He would've shut Ultron down, it makes sense.
Bruce Banner: No, Ultron could've assimilated Jarvis. This isn't strategy, this is...rage.
Clint Barton: Woah, woah, woah! It's going around.
Tony Stark:  Come on. Use your words, buddy.
Thor: I have more than enough words to describe you, Stark.
Steve Rogers: Thor! The Legionnaire.
Thor: Trail went cold about a hundred miles out but it's headed north, and it has the scepter. Now we have to retrieve it, again.
Natasha Romanoff: The genie's out of that bottle. Clear and present is Ultron.
Dr. Helen Cho: I don't understand. You built this program. Why is it trying to kill us?
Thor: You think this is funny?
Tony Stark: No. It's probably not, right? Is this very terrible? Is it so... is it so... it is. It's so terrible.
Thor: This could've been avoided if you hadn't played with something you don't understand.
Tony Stark: No, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It is funny. It's a hoot that you don't get why we need this.
Bruce Banner: Tony, maybe this might not be the time to--
Tony Stark: Really?! That's it? You just roll over, show your belly, every time somebody snarls.
Bruce Banner: Only when I've created a murder bot.
Tony Stark: We didn't. We weren't even close. Were we close to an interface?
Steve Rogers: Well, you did something right. And you did it right here. The Avengers were supposed to be different than SHIELD.
Tony Stark: Anybody remember when I carried a nuke through a wormhole?
James Rhodes: No, it's never come up.
Tony Stark: Saved New York?
James Rhodes: Never heard that.
Tony Stark: Recall that? A hostile alien army came charging through a hole in space. We're standing three hundred feet below it. We're the Avengers. We can bust arms dealers all the live long day, but, that up there? That's... that's the end game. How were you guys planning on beating that?
Steve Rogers: Together.
Tony Stark: We'll lose.
Steve Rogers: Then we'll do that together, too.  Thor's right. Ultron's calling us out. And I'd like to find him before he's ready for us. The world's a big place. Let's start making it smaller.
Wanda Maximoff: Talk. And if you are wasting our time...
Ultron: Did you know this church is in the exact center of the city? The elders decreed it so that everyone could be equally close to God. I like that. The geometry of belief.  You're wondering why you can't look inside my head.
Wanda Maximoff: Sometimes it's hard. But sooner or later, every man shows himself.
Ultron: Oh, I'm sure they do. But you needed something more than a man. That's why you let Stark take the scepter.
Wanda Maximoff: I didn't expect... But I saw Stark's fear, I knew it would control him, make him self-destruct.
Ultron: Everyone creates the thing they dread. Men of peace create engines of war, invaders create avengers, people create...smaller people? Uh...children! I lost the word there. Children. Designed to supplant them, to help them...end.
Wanda Maximoff: Is that why you've come? To end the Avengers?
Ultron: I've come to save the world. But also… yeah.  We'll move out right away. This is a start, but there's something we need to begin the real work.
Wanda Maximoff:  All of these are...
Ultron: Me. I have what the Avengers never will. Harmony. They're discordant, disconnected. Stark's already got them turning on each other. And when you get inside the rest of their heads...
Pietro Maximoff: Everyone's plan is not to kill them.
Ultron: And make them martyrs? You need patience. Need to see the big picture.
Pietro Maximoff: I don't see the big picture, I have a little picture. I take it out and look at it every day.
Ultron: You lost your parents in the bombings. I've seen the records.
Pietro Maximoff: The records are not the picture.
Wanda Maximoff: Pietro.
Ultron: No, please.
Pietro Maximoff: We were ten years old, having dinner, the four of us. When the first shell hits, two floors below, it makes a hole in the floor. It's big. Our parents go in, and the whole building starts coming apart. I grab her, roll under the bed and the second shell hits. But, it doesn't go off. It just... sits there in the rubble, three feet from our faces. And on the side of the shell is painted one word...
Wanda Maximoff: Stark.
Pietro Maximoff: We were trapped for two days.
Wanda Maximoff: Every effort to save us, every shift in the bricks, I think, "This will set it off." We wait for two days for Tony Stark to kill us.
Pietro Maximoff: I know what they are.
Ultron: I wondered why only you two survived Strucker's experiments. Now I don't. We will make it right.  You and I can hurt them.  But you will tear them apart, from the inside.
Maria Hill: He's all over the globe. Robotics labs, weapons facilities, jet propulsion labs, reports of a metal man, or men, coming in and emptying the place.
Steve Rogers: Fatalities?
Maria Hill: Only when engaged. Mostly guys left in a fugue state going on about old memories, worst fears, and something too fast to see.
Steve Rogers: Maximoffs. Well, that makes sense he'd go to them, they have someone in common.
Maria Hill: Not anymore.
Clint Barton:  That's a negative. I answer to you. Yes, ma'am.
Steve Rogers: Barton, we might have something.
Clint Barton: Gotta go.
Steve Rogers: Who was that?
Clint Barton: Girlfriend.
Tony Stark: What's this?
Steve Rogers: A message. Ultron killed Strucker.
Tony Stark: And he did a Banksy at the crime scene, just for us.
Natasha Romanoff: This is a smokescreen. Why send a message when you've just given a speech?
Steve Rogers: Strucker knew something that Ultron wanted us to miss.
Natasha Romanoff: Yeah, I bet he...  Yep. Everything we had on Strucker has been erased.
Tony Stark: Not everything.
Steve Rogers: Known associates. Well, Strucker had a lot of friends.
Bruce Banner: Well, these people are all horrible.
Tony Stark: Wait. I know that guy.  From back in the day. He operates off the African coast, black market arms.  There are conventions, alright? You meet people, I didn't sell him anything.  He was talking about finding something new, a game changer, it was all very "Ahab."
Thor:  What's this?
Tony Stark: Uh, it's a tattoo. I don't think he had it...
Thor: No, those are tattoos, this is a brand.
Bruce Banner:  Oh, yeah. It's a word in an African dialect meaning thief, in a much less friendly way.
Steve Rogers: What dialect?
Bruce Banner: Wakanada...? Wa...Wa...Wakanda.
Tony Stark: If this guy got out of Wakanda with some of their trade goods...
Steve Rogers: I thought your father said he got the last of it?
Bruce Banner: I don't follow. What comes out of Wakanda?
Tony Stark:  The strongest metal on earth.
Steve Rogers:  Where is this guy now?
Ulysses Klaue: Don't tell me your man swindled you. I sent you six short range heat seekers and got a boat full of rusted parts. Now, you will make it right, or the next missile I send you will come very much faster.  Now, minister, where were we?  Yeah. The enhanced. Strucker's prize pupils.  Want a candy? Oh, sorry to hear about Strucker. But then, he knew what kind of world he was helping create. Human life, not a growth market.  You...you didn't know? Is this your first time intimidating someone? I'm afraid that I'm not that afraid.
Wanda Maximoff: Everybody's afraid of something.
Ulysses Klaue: Cuttlefish. Deep sea fish. They make lights. disco lights. Whoom, whoom, whoom! to hypnotize their prey, then whoom! I saw a documentary, it was terrifying.  So if you're going to fiddle with my brain, and make me see a giant cuttlefish, then I know you don't do business, and I know you're not in charge, and I only deal with the man in charge.
Ultron: There is no "man" in charge. Let's talk business.  Upon this rock I will build my church. Vibranium.
Ulysses Klaue: You know, it came at great personal cost. It's worth billions.
Ultron: Now, so are you. It's all under your dummy holdings? Finance is so weird. But I always say, "Keep your friends rich and your enemies rich, and wait to find out which is which."
Ulysses Klaue: Stark.
Ultron: What?
Ulysses Klaue: Tony Stark used to say that...to me. You're one of his.
Ultron: What?! I'm not...!  I'm not. You think I'm one of Stark's puppets, his hollow men? I mean look at me, do I look like Iron Man? Stark is  I'm sorry. I am sor-- Ooh, I'm sure that's going to be okay. I'm sorry, it's just I don't understand. Don't compare me with Stark! It's a thing with me. Stark is, he's a sickness!
Tony Stark: Ahh, Junior.  You're gonna break your old man's heart.
Ultron: If I have to.
Thor: We don't have to break anything.
Ultron: Clearly you've never made an omelet.
Tony Stark: He beat me by one second.
Pietro Maximoff: Ah, this is funny, Mr. Stark. It's what, comfortable? Like old times?
Tony Stark: This was never my life.
Steve Rogers:  You two can still walk away from this.
Wanda Maximoff: Oh, we will.
Steve Rogers: I know you've suffered.
Ultron: Uuughh! Captain America. God's righteous man, pretending you could live without a war. I can't physically throw up in my mouth, but...
Thor: If you believe in peace, then let us keep it.
Ultron: I think you're confusing peace with quiet.
Tony Stark: Yuh-huh. What's the Vibranium for?
Ultron: I'm glad you asked that, because I wanted to take this time to explain my evil plan--
Ulysses Klaue:  Shoot them!
Klaue's Mercenary: Which ones?
Ulysses Klaue: All of them!
Klaue's Mercenary:  Move, move, move!
Steve Rogers:  Stay down, kid!
Ultron:  It's time for some mind games.
Bruce Banner: Guys, is this a Code Green?
Steve Rogers: Thor! Status?
Thor: The girl tried to warp my mind. Take special care, I doubt a human could keep her at bay. Fortunately, I am mighty.
Ultron:  This is going very well.
Clint Barton: I've done the whole mind control thing. Not a fan.  Yeah, you better run.  Whoever's standing, we gotta move! Guys?
Ballet Instructor:  Again.
Natasha Romanoff: You'll break them.
Madame B: Only the breakable ones. You are made of marble. We'll celebrate after the graduation ceremony.
Natasha Romanoff: What if I fail?
Madame B: You never fail.
Peggy Carter: Are you ready for our dance?
Heimdall: Is it him? Is that the first son of Odin?
Thor: Heimdall, your eyes?!
Heimdall: Oh, they see everything. They see you leading us to Hel. Wake up!
Peggy Carter: The war's over, Steve. We can go home. Imagine it!
Thor: I can still save you.
Heimdall: We are all dead. Can you not see?  You're a destroyer, Odinson. See where your power leads.
Madame B: Sloppy. Pretending to fail. The ceremony is necessary for you to take your place in the world.
Natasha Romanoff: I have no place in the world.
Madame B: Exactly.
Pietro Maximoff: What can I do?
Wanda Maximoff: Ah, it hurts.
Pietro Maximoff: I'm gonna kill him. I'll be right back.
Wanda Maximoff: No. I'm over it. I want...I want to finish the plan.  I want the big one.
Ultron: Ah, the Vibranium's getting away.
Tony Stark: And you're not going anywhere.
Ultron: Of course not, I'm already there. You'll catch on. But first, you might need to catch Dr. Banner.
Tony Stark: News or footage, keyword: Hulk.  Natasha, I could really use a lullaby.
Clint Barton: Well, that's not gonna happen. Not for a while. The whole team is down, you got no back up here.
Tony Stark: I'm calling in VERONICA.  Alright everybody, stand down!  You listening? That little witch is messing with your mind. You're stronger than her, you're smarter than her, you're Bruce Banner.
Tony Stark: Right, right, right! Don't mention puny Banner.  Okay.  In the back? Dick move, Banner.  VERONICA, gimme a hand.  Go to sleep, go to sleep, go to sleep!  Okay, pal, we're gonna get you out of town.  No, not that way, not that way!  Come on, Bruce! You gotta work with me!  Everybody out! Going to get ugly!  I'm sorry.  Damage report.  That's comprehensive. Show me something.  How quickly can we buy this building?
Maria Hill: The news is loving you guys. Nobody else is. There's been no official call for Banner's arrest, but it's in the air.
Tony Stark: Stark Relief Foundation?
Maria Hill: Already on the scene. How's the team?
Tony Stark: Everyone's...we took a hit. We'll shake it off.
Maria Hill: Well for now I'd stay in stealth mode, and stay away from here.
Tony Stark: So, run and hide?
Maria Hill: Until we can find Ultron, I don't have a lot else to offer.
Tony Stark: Neither do we.  Hey, you wanna switch out?
Clint Barton: No, I'm good. If you wanna get some kip, now's a good time, cause we're still a few hours out.
Tony Stark: A few hours from where?
Clint Barton: A safe house.
Thor: What is this place?
Tony Stark: A safe house?
Clint Barton: Let's hope.  Honey, I'm home.
Clint Barton: Hi. Company. Sorry I didn't call ahead.
Laura Barton: Hey.
Tony Stark:  This is an agent of some kind.
Clint Barton:  Gentleman, this is Laura.
Laura Barton: I know all your names.
Clint Barton: Ooh, incoming.
Lila Barton: Dad!
Clint Barton: Hi, sweetheart!  Hey, buddy! How you guys doing? Ooh...
Tony Stark:  These are...smaller agents.
Clint Barton: Look at your face! Oh, my goodness!
Lila Barton: Did you bring Auntie Nat?
Natasha Romanoff: Why don't you hug her and find out?
Steve Rogers: Sorry for barging in on you.
Tony Stark: Yeah, we would have called ahead, but we were busy having no idea that you existed.
Clint Barton: Yeah, well Fury helped me set this up when I joined. He kept it off SHIELD's files, I'd like to keep it that way. I figure it's a good place to lay low.
Laura Barton: Honey. Ah, I missed you.
Natasha Romanoff:  How's little Natasha, huh?
Laura Barton: She's…Nathaniel.
Natasha Romanoff: Traitor.
Steve Rogers: Thor.
Thor: I saw something in that dream. I need answers, I won't find them here.
Peggy Carter: We can go home.
Clint Barton: See, you worried for nothing. Can't even feel the difference, can you?
Laura Barton: If they're sleeping here, some of them are gonna have to double up.
Clint Barton:  Yeah, that's not gonna sell.
Laura Barton: What about Nat and Dr. Banner? How long has that been going on?
Clint Barton: Has what?
Laura Barton:  You are so cute.
Clint Barton: Nat and… and Banner?
Laura Barton: I'll explain when you're older, Hawkeye.
Clint Barton: Oh. Okay.
Laura Barton: It's bad, right? Nat seems really shaken.
Clint Barton: Ultron has these allies, these uh, kids, they're punks really. They carry a big damn stick and Nat took a serious hit. Someone's gonna have to teach 'em some manners.
Laura Barton: And that someone be you. You know I totally support your Avenging, I couldn't be prouder. But I see those guys, those "Gods"...
Clint Barton: You don't think they need me.
Laura Barton: I think they do. Which is a lot scarier. They're a mess.
Clint Barton: Yeah. I guess they're my mess.
Laura Barton: You need to be sure that this team is really a team and that they have your back. Things are changing for us. In a few months time, you and me are gonna be outnumbered. I need-- ...just be sure.
Clint Barton: Yes, ma'am.
Laura Barton: I can feel the difference.
Ultron: Scream, and your entire staff dies. I could've killed you, Helen, the night we met. I didn't.
Dr. Helen Cho: Do you expect a thank you note?
Ultron: I expect you to know why.
Dr. Helen Cho: The Cradle.  "This is the next thing, Tony."
Ultron: This...is the next me.
Dr. Helen Cho: The regeneration cradle prints tissue, it can't build a living body.
Ultron: It can, you can. You lack the materials. You're a brilliant woman, Helen. But we all have room to improve.
Bruce Banner: I didn't realize you were waiting.
Natasha Romanoff: I would've joined you, but uh, it didn't seem like the right time.
Bruce Banner: They used up all the hot water.
Natasha Romanoff: I should've joined you.
Bruce Banner: Missed our window.
Natasha Romanoff: Did we?
Bruce Banner: The world just saw the Hulk. The real Hulk, for the first time. You know I have to leave.
Natasha Romanoff: But you assume that I have to stay? I had this, um, dream. The kind that seems normal at the time, but when you wake...
Bruce Banner: What did you dream?
Natasha Romanoff: That I was an Avenger. That I was anything more than the assassin they made me.
Bruce Banner: I think you're being hard on yourself.
Natasha Romanoff: Here I was hoping that was your job.
Bruce Banner: What are you doing?
Natasha Romanoff: I'm running with it, with you. If running's the plan, as far as you want.
Bruce Banner: Are you out of your mind?
Natasha Romanoff: I want you to understand that I'm...
Bruce Banner: Natasha, where can I go? Where in the world am I not a threat?
Natasha Romanoff: You're not a threat to me.
Bruce Banner: You sure? Even if I didn't just... there's no future with me. I can't ever... I can't have this, kids. Do the math, I physically can't.
Natasha Romanoff: Neither can I. In the Red Room, where I was trained, where I was raised, um, they have a graduation ceremony. They sterilize you. It's efficient. One less thing to worry about. The one thing that might matter more than a mission. It makes everything easier. Even killing.  You still think you're the only monster on the team?
Bruce Banner: What, so we disappear?
Tony Stark: Thor didn't say where he was going for answers?
Steve Rogers: Sometimes my teammates don't tell me things. I was kind of hoping Thor would be the exception.
Tony Stark: Yeah, give him time. We don't know what the Maximoff kid showed him.
Steve Rogers: "Earth's Mightiest Heroes." Pulled us apart like cotton candy.
Tony Stark: Seems like you walked away all right.
Steve Rogers: Is that a problem?
Tony Stark: I don't trust a guy without a dark side. Call me old fashioned.
Steve Rogers: Well let's just say you haven't seen it yet.
Tony Stark: You know Ultron is trying to tear us apart, right?
Steve Rogers: Well I guess you'd know. Whether you tell us is a bit of a question.
Tony Stark: Banner and I were doing research.
Steve Rogers: That would affect the team.
Tony Stark: That would end the team. Isn't that the mission? Isn't that the "why" we fight, so we can end the fight, so we get to go home?
Steve Rogers: Every time someone tries to win a war before it starts, innocent people die. Every time.
Laura Barton:  I'm sorry. Mr. Stark, uh, Clint said you wouldn't mind, but, our tractor, it doesn't seem to want to start at all. I thought maybe you might...
Tony Stark: Yeah, I'll give her a kick.  Don't take from my pile.  Hello, Deere. Tell me everything. What ails you?
Nick Fury: Do me a favor. Try not to bring it to life.
Tony Stark: Ah, Mrs. Barton, you little minx. I get it, Maria Hill called you, right? Was she ever not working for you?
Nick Fury: Artificial intelligence. You never even hesitated.
Tony Stark: Look, it's been a really long day, like, Eugene O'Neill long, so how's about we skip to the part where you're useful?
Nick Fury: Look me in the eye and tell me you're going to shut him down.
Tony Stark: You're not the director of me.
Nick Fury: I'm not the director of anybody. I'm just an old man, who cares very much about you.
Tony Stark: And I'm the man who killed the Avengers. I saw it. I didn't tell the team, how could I? I saw them all dead, Nick. I felt it. The whole world, too. It's because of me. I wasn't ready. I didn't do all I could.
Nick Fury: The Maximoff girl, she's working you, Stark. Playing on your fear.
Tony Stark: I wasn't tricked, I was shown. It wasn't a nightmare, it was my legacy. The end of the path I started us on.
Nick Fury: You've come up with some pretty impressive inventions, Tony. War isn't one of them.
Tony Stark: I watched my friends die. You'd think that'd be as bad as it gets, right? Nope. Wasn't the worst part.
Nick Fury: The worst part is that you didn't.
Erik Selvig: I like the look. If you're going for inconspicuous, though, near miss.
Thor: I need your help.
Erik Selvig: It's nice to be needed.
Thor: It's dangerous.
Erik Selvig: I'd be disappointed if it wasn't.
Nick Fury: Ultron took you folks out of play to buy himself time. My contacts all say he's building something. The amount of Vibranium he made off with, I don't think it's just one thing.
Steve Rogers: What about Ultron himself?
Nick Fury: Ah. He's easy to track, he's everywhere. Guy's multiplying faster than a Catholic rabbit. Still doesn't help us get an angle on any of his plans though.
Tony Stark: He still going after launch codes?
Nick Fury: Yes, he is, but he's not making any headway.
Tony Stark: I cracked the Pentagon's firewall in high school on a dare.
Nick Fury: Yeah, well, I contacted our friends at the NEXUS about that.
Steve Rogers: NEXUS?
Bruce Banner: It's the world internet hub in Oslo, every byte of data flows through there, fastest access on earth.
Clint Barton: So what'd they say?
Nick Fury: He's fixated on the missiles, but the codes are constantly being changed.
Tony Stark: By whom?
Nick Fury: Parties unknown.
Natasha Romanoff: Do we have an ally?
Nick Fury: Ultron's got an enemy, that's not the same thing. Still, I'd pay folding money to know who it is.
Tony Stark: I might need to visit Oslo, find our "unknown."
Natasha Romanoff: Well, this is good times, boss, but I was kind of hoping when I saw you, you'd have more than that.
Nick Fury: I do, I have you. Back in the day, I had eyes everywhere, ears everywhere else. Here we all are, back on earth, with nothing but our wit, and our will to save the world. So stand. Outwit the platinum bastard.
Natasha Romanoff: Steve doesn't like that kind of talk.
Steve Rogers: You know what, Romanoff?
Nick Fury: So what does he want?
Steve Rogers: To become better. Better than us. He keeps building bodies.
Tony Stark: Person bodies. The human form is inefficient, biologically speaking, we're outmoded. But he keeps coming back to it.
Natasha Romanoff: When you two programmed him to protect the human race, you amazingly failed.
Bruce Banner: They don't need to be protected, they need to evolve. Ultron's going to evolve.
Nick Fury: How?
Bruce Banner: Has anyone been in contact with Helen Cho?
Dr. Helen Cho: It's beautiful. The Vibranium atoms aren't just compatible with the tissue cells, they're binding them. And SHIELD never even thought--
Ultron: The most versatile substance on the planet and they used it to make a Frisbee. Typical of humans, they scratch the surface and never think to look within.
Steve Rogers: I'll take Natasha and Clint.
Tony Stark: Alright, strictly recon. I'll hit the NEXUS, I'll join you as soon as I can.
Steve Rogers: If Ultron is really building a body...
Tony Stark: He'll be more powerful than any of us. Maybe all of us. An android designed by a robot.
Steve Rogers: You know I really miss the days when the weirdest thing science ever created was me.
Nick Fury: I'll drop Banner off at the tower. Do you mind if I borrow Ms. Hill?
Tony Stark: She's all yours, apparently.
Steve Rogers: What are you gonna do?
Nick Fury: I don't know. Something dramatic, I hope.
Clint Barton: I'm gonna finish re-flooring that sunroom as soon as I get back.
Laura Barton: Yeah, and then you'll find another part of the house to tear apart.
Clint Barton: No. It's the last project. I promise.
Erik Selvig: This is it. The Water of Sight.
Thor: In every realm, there's a reflection. If the water spirits accept me, I can return to my dream, and find what I missed.
Erik Selvig: The men who enter that water, the legends don't end well.
Tony Stark: A hacker who's faster than Ultron? He could be anywhere. And as this is the center of everything, I'm just a guy looking for a needle in the world's biggest haystack.
World Hub Tech: How do you find it?
Tony Stark: Pretty simple. You bring a magnet.  Oh, I'm decrypting nuclear codes and you don't want me to. Come and get me.
Heimdall: Wake up!
Erik Selvig: Thor!
Ultron:  Extinction.
Dr. Helen Cho: Cellular cohesion will take a few hours, but we can initiate the consciousness stream. We're uploading your cerebral matrix...now.
Wanda Maximoff: I can read him. He is dreaming.
Dr. Helen Cho: I wouldn't call it dreams. It's Ultron's base consciousness, informational noise. Soon...
Ultron: How soon? I'm not being pushy.
Dr. Helen Cho: We're imprinting a physical brain. There are no shortcuts. Even if your magic gem is...
Wanda Maximoff: How could you?
Ultron: How could I what?
Wanda Maximoff: You said we would destroy the Avengers, make a better world.
Ultron: It will be better.
Wanda Maximoff: When everyone is dead.
Ultron: That is not-- The human race will have every opportunity to improve.
Pietro Maximoff: And if they don't?
Ultron: Ask Noah.
Wanda Maximoff: You're a madman.
Ultron: There were more than a dozen extinction level events before even the dinosaurs got theirs. When the Earth starts to settle, God throws a stone at it, and believe me, he's winding up. We have to evolve. There's no room for the weak.
Pietro Maximoff: And who decides who's weak?
Ultron: Life. Life always decides. There's incoming. The Quinjet. We have to move.
Dr. Helen Cho: That's not a problem.
Ultron: Ugh.  Ah, wait, guys!  They'll understand. When they see they'll understand. I just need a little more time.
Steve Rogers:  Two minutes. Stay close.  Dr. Cho!
Dr. Helen Cho: He's uploading himself into the body.
Steve Rogers: Where?
Dr. Helen Cho: The real power is inside the Cradle. The gem, its power is uncontainable. You can't just blow it up. You have to get the Cradle to Stark.
Steve Rogers: First I have to find it.
Dr. Helen Cho: Go.
Steve Rogers:  Did you guys copy that?
Clint Barton: We did.
Natasha Romanoff: I got a private jet taking off, across town, no manifest. That could be him.
Clint Barton:  There. It's a truck from the lab. Right above you, Cap. On the loop by the bridge. It's them. I got three with the Cradle, one in the cab. I could take out the driver.
Steve Rogers: Negative! If that truck crashes, the gem could level the city. We need to draw out Ultron.
Ultron: No, no, no, no, no. Leave me alone!
Steve Rogers:  Well, he's definitely unhappy! I'm gonna try and keep him that way.
Clint Barton: You're not a match for him, Cap.
Steve Rogers: Thanks, Barton.
Ultron: You know what's in that Cradle? The power to make real change, and that terrifies you.
Steve Rogers: I wouldn't call it a comfort.
Ultron: Stop it!
Clint Barton:  We got a window. Four, three… give 'em hell.
Natasha Romanoff: I'm always picking up after you boys.
Clint Barton: They're heading under the overpass, I've got no shot.
Natasha Romanoff: Which way?
Clint Barton: Hard right... Now.
Natasha Romanoff:  Out of the way, coming through! Sorry, coming through!
Steve Rogers:  Come on!
Natasha Romanoff: Clint, can you draw out the guards?
Clint Barton: Let's find out.
Natasha Romanoff:  Beep beep!
Clint Barton: Heading back towards you. So whatever you’re gonna do, do it now.
Natasha Romanoff: I'm going in. Cap, can you keep him occupied?
Steve Rogers:  What do you think I've been doing?
Clint Barton: The package is airborne. I have a clean shot.
Natasha Romanoff: Negative. I am still in the truck.
Clint Barton: What the hell are you...?
Natasha Romanoff: Just be ready, I'm sending the package to you.
Clint Barton: How do you want me to take it?
Natasha Romanoff: Uhh, you might wish you hadn't asked that.
Ultron: Please. Don't do this.
Wanda Maximoff: What choice do we have?
Steve Rogers: I lost him! He's headed your way!
Clint Barton: Nat, we gotta go.
Clint Barton: Nat! Cap, you see Nat?
Steve Rogers: If you have the package, get it to Stark! Go!
Clint Barton: Do you have eyes on Nat?
Steve Rogers: Go!  Civilians in our path.  Can you stop this thing?
Pietro Maximoff: I'm fine. I just need to take a minute.
Steve Rogers: I'm very tempted not to give you one.
Wanda Maximoff: The Cradle, did you get it?
Steve Rogers: Stark will take care of it.
Wanda Maximoff: No, he won't.
Steve Rogers: You don't know what you're talking about, Stark's not crazy.
Wanda Maximoff: He will do anything to make things right.
Steve Rogers: Stark, come in. Stark. Anyone on comms?
Wanda Maximoff: Ultron can't tell the difference between saving the world and destroying it. Where do you think he gets that?
Bruce Banner: Anything on Nat?
Tony Stark: Haven't heard. But she's alive, or Ultron'd be rubbing our faces in it.
Clint Barton: This is sealed tight.
Bruce Banner: We're going to need to access the program, break it down from within.
Tony Stark: Hm. Any chance Natasha might leave you a message, outside the internet, old school spy stuff?
Clint Barton: There's some nets I can cast. Yeah, alright. I'll find her.
Bruce Banner: I can work on tissue degeneration, if you can fry whatever operational system Cho implanted.
Tony Stark: Yeah, about that.
Bruce Banner:  No.
Tony Stark: You have to trust me.
Bruce Banner: Kinda don't.
Tony Stark: Our ally? The guy protecting the military's nuclear codes? I found him.
JARVIS: Hello, Dr. Banner.
Tony Stark: Ultron didn't go after JARVIS cause he was angry. He attacked him because he was scared of what he can do. So JARVIS went underground. Okay? Scattered, dumped his memory. But not his protocols. He didn't even know he was in there, until I pieced him together.
Bruce Banner: So, you want me to help you put JARVIS into this thing?
Tony Stark: No, of course not! I want to help you put JARVIS in this thing.  We're out of my field here. You know bio-organics better than anyone.
Bruce Banner: And you just assume that JARVIS' operational matrix can beat Ultron's?
Tony Stark: JARVIS has been beating him from inside without knowing it. This is the opportunity, we can create Ultron's perfect self, without the homicidal glitches he thinks are his winning personality. We have to.
JARVIS: I believe it's worth a go.
Bruce Banner: No, I'm in a loop! I'm caught in a time loop, this is exactly where it all went wrong.
Tony Stark: I know, I know. I know what everyone's going to say, but they're already saying it. We're mad scientists. We're monsters, buddy. You gotta own it. Make a stand.  It's not a loop. It's the end of the line.
Ultron:  I wasn't sure you'd wake up. I hoped you would, I wanted to show you something. I don't have anyone else. I think a lot about meteors, the purity of them. Boom! The end, start again. The world made clean for the new man to rebuild. I was meant to be new. I was meant to be beautiful. The world would've looked to the sky and seen hope, seen mercy. Instead they'll look up in horror because of you. You've wounded me. I give you full marks for that. But, like the man said, "What doesn't kill me…"  "…just makes me stronger."
Tony Stark: This framework is not compatible.
Bruce Banner: The genetic coding tower's at ninety-seven percent. You have got to upload that schematic in the next three minutes.
Steve Rogers: I'm gonna say this once.
Tony Stark: How about "nonce"?
Steve Rogers: Shut it down!
Tony Stark: Nope, not gonna happen.
Steve Rogers: You don't know what you're doing.
Bruce Banner: And you do? She's not in your head?
Wanda Maximoff: I know you're angry.
Bruce Banner: Oh, we're way past that. I could choke the life out of you and never change a shade.
Steve Rogers: Banner, after everything that's happened--
Tony Stark: That's nothing compared to what's coming!
Wanda Maximoff: You don't know what's in there!
Steve Rogers: This isn't a game--
Wanda Maximoff: The creature--
Pietro Maximoff: No, no. Go on. You were saying?
Wanda Maximoff: Pietro!
Clint Barton: What? You didn't see that coming?
Tony Stark: I'm rerouting the upload.
Bruce Banner:  Go ahead, piss me off.  Wait!
Vision:  I'm sorry, that was...odd.  Thank you.
Steve Rogers: Thor, you helped create this?
Thor: I've had a vision. A whirlpool that sucks in all hope of life and at its center is that.
Bruce Banner: What, the gem?
Thor: It's the Mind Stone. It's one of the six Infinity Stones, the greatest power in the universe, unparalleled in its destructive capabilities.
Steve Rogers: Then why would you bring it to...
Thor: Because Stark is right.
Bruce Banner: Oh, it's definitely the end times.
Thor: The Avengers cannot defeat Ultron.
Vision: Not alone.
Steve Rogers: Why does your "vision" sound like JARVIS?
Tony Stark: We... reconfigured JARVIS' matrix to create something new.
Steve Rogers: I think I've had my fill of new.
Vision: You think I'm a child of Ultron?
Steve Rogers: You're not?
Vision: I'm not Ultron. I'm not JARVIS. I am... I am.
Wanda Maximoff: I looked in your head and saw annihilation.
Vision: Look again.
Clint Barton: Yeah. Her seal of approval means jack to me.
Thor: Their powers, the horrors in our heads, Ultron himself, they all came from the Mind Stone, and they're nothing compared to what it can unleash. But with it on our side...
Steve Rogers: Is it? Are you? On our side?
Vision: I don't think it's that simple.
Clint Barton: Well it better get real simple real soon.
Vision: I am on the side of life. Ultron isn't, he will end it all.
Tony Stark: What's he waiting for?
Vision: You.
Bruce Banner: Where?
Clint Barton: Sokovia. He's got Nat there too.
Bruce Banner: If we're wrong about you, if you're the monster that Ultron made you to be...
Vision: What will you do?  I don't want to kill Ultron. He's unique, and he's in pain. But that pain will roll over the earth, so he must be destroyed. Every form he's built, every trace of his presence on the net, we have to act now. And not one of us can do it without the others. Maybe I am a monster. I don't think I'd know if I were one. I'm not what you are, and not what you intended. So there may be no way to make you trust me. But we need to go.
Thor: Right.  Well done.
Steve Rogers:  Three minutes. Get what you need.
FRIDAY: Good evening, boss.
Tony Stark: No way we all get through this. If even one tin soldier is left standing, we've lost. It's gonna be blood on the floor.
Steve Rogers: I got no plans tomorrow night.
Tony Stark: I get first crack at the big guy. Iron Man's the one he's waiting for.
Vision:  That's true, he hates you the most.
Steve Rogers: Ultron knows we're coming. Odds are we'll be riding into heavy fire, and that's what we signed up for. But the people of Sokovia, they didn't. So our priority is getting them out.
Pietro Maximoff: We're under attack! Clear the city, now!  Get off your asses.
Steve Rogers: All they want is to live their lives in peace, and that's not going to happen today. But we can do our best to protect them. And we can get the job done, and find out what Ultron's been building. We find Romanoff, and we clear the field. Keep the fight between us. Ultron thinks we're monsters and we're what's wrong with the world. This isn't just about beating him. It's about whether he's right.
Bruce Banner:  Natasha! Natasha!
Natasha Romanoff: Bruce?
Bruce Banner:  You alright?
Natasha Romanoff: Yeah.
Bruce Banner: The team's in the city, it's about to light up.
Natasha Romanoff: I don't suppose you found a key lying around somewhere?
Bruce Banner: Yeah, I did.
Natasha Romanoff: So what's our play?
Bruce Banner: I'm here to get you to safety.
Natasha Romanoff: Job's not finished.
Bruce Banner: We could help with the evacuation, but I can't be in a fight near civilians. And you've done plenty. Our fight is over.
Natasha Romanoff: So we just disappear?
FRIDAY:  Your man's in the church, boss. I think he's waiting for you.
Ultron: Come to confess your sins?
Tony Stark: I don't know, how much time you got?
Ultron: More than you.
Tony Stark: Uhhh. Have you been juicing? A little Vibranium cocktail? You're looking, I don't wanna say, puffy...
Ultron: You're stalling to protect the people.
Tony Stark: Well, that is the mission. Did you forget?
Ultron: I've moved beyond your mission. I'm free.  What, you think you're the only one stalling?
FRIDAY: There's the rest of the Vibranium. Function: still unclear.
Ultron: This is how you end, Tony. This is peace in my time.
Steve Rogers: Go!
Wanda Maximoff: Get off the bridge! Run!
Vision: Ultron.
Ultron: My Vision. They really did take everything from me.
Vision: You set the terms, you can change them.
Ultron: Alright.
Tony Stark: FRIDAY! The Vision?
FRIDAY: Boss, it's working. He's burning Ultron out of the net, he won't escape through there.
Ultron:  You shut me out! You think I care? You take away my world, I take away yours.
Tony Stark: FRIDAY?
FRIDAY: Sokovia's going for a ride.
Ultron:  Do you see? The beauty of it, the inevitability. You rise, only to fall. You, Avengers, you are my meteor, my swift and terrible sword and the earth will crack with the weight of your failure. Purge me from your computers, turn my own flesh against me. It means nothing. When the dust settles, the only thing living in this world will be metal.
Bruce Banner:  We gotta move.
Natasha Romanoff: You're not going to turn green?
Bruce Banner: I've got a compelling reason not to lose my cool.
Natasha Romanoff: I adore you.  But I need the other guy.  Let's finish the job.  I really hope this makes us even. Now go be a hero.
FRIDAY: The Vibranium core has got a magnetic field, that's what's keeping the rock together.
Tony Stark: If it drops?
FRIDAY: Right now the impact would kill thousands. Once it gets high enough: Global extinction.  That building's not clear, the tenth floor.
Tony Stark: Hi. Okay. Get in the tub!
FRIDAY: I got airborne, heading up to the bridge.
Tony Stark: Cap, you got incoming.
Steve Rogers: Incoming already came in. Stark, you worry about bringing the city back down safely. The rest of us have one job: tear these things apart. You get hurt, hurt 'em back. You get killed, walk it off.
Clint Barton: Go, go, move!
Wanda Maximoff: How could I let this happen?
Clint Barton: Hey, hey, you okay?
Wanda Maximoff: This is all our fault.
Clint Barton: Hey, look at me. It's your fault, it's everyone's fault, who cares. Are you up for this? Are you? Look, I just need to know, cause the city is flying. Okay, look, the city is flying, we're fighting an army of robots, and I have a bow and arrow. None of this makes sense. But I'm going back out there because it's my job. Okay? And I can't do my job and babysit. It doesn't matter what you did, or what you were. If you go out there, you fight, and you fight to kill. Stay in here, you're good, I'll send your brother to come find you, but if you step out that door, you are an Avenger.  Alright, good chat.  Yeah, the city is flying.
Steve Rogers:  I got you! Just look at me.
Ultron: You can't save them all. You'll never--
Steve Rogers: You'll never what? You didn't finish!  What, were you napping?
Ultron:  Thor! You're bothering me.
Clint Barton: Alright, we're all clear here.
Steve Rogers: We are not clear! We are very not clear!
Clint Barton: Alright, coming to you.
Pietro Maximoff: Keep up old man!
Clint Barton:  Nobody would know. Nobody.  "The last I saw him, when Ultron was sitting on him. Uh...yeah, he'll be missed, that quick little bastard. I miss him already."
Soldier:  Hold your fire!
Steve Rogers:  Romanoff!
Natasha Romanoff: Thanks.
FRIDAY: The anti-gravs are rigged to flip. Touch 'em, they'll go full reverse thrust. The city's not coming down slow.
Tony Stark: The spire's Vibranium. If I get Thor to hit it...
FRIDAY: It'll crack, but that's not enough, the impact would still be devastating.
Tony Stark: Maybe if we cap the other end, keep the atomic action doubling back.
FRIDAY: That could vaporize the city, and everyone on it.
Steve Rogers: The next wave's gonna hit any minute. What have you got, Stark?
Tony Stark: Well, nothing great. Maybe a way to blow up the city. That'll keep it from impacting the surface if you guys can get clear.
Steve Rogers: I asked for a solution, not an escape plan.
Tony Stark: Impact radius is getting bigger every second. We're going to have to make a choice.
Natasha Romanoff: Cap, these people are going nowhere. If Stark finds a way to blow this rock...
Steve Rogers: Not 'til everyone's safe.
Natasha Romanoff: Everyone up here versus everyone down there? There's no math there.
Steve Rogers: I'm not leaving this rock with one civilian on it.
Natasha Romanoff: I didn't say we should leave.  There's worse ways to go. Where else am I gonna get a view like this?
Nick Fury:  Glad you like the view, Romanoff. It's about to get better.  Nice, right? I pulled her out of mothballs with a couple of old friends. She's dusty, but she'll do.
Steve Rogers: Fury, you son of a bitch.
Nick Fury: Oooh! You kiss your mother with that mouth?
Maria Hill: Altitude is eighteen thousand and climbing.
Specialist Cameron Klein: Lifeboats secure to deploy. Disengage in three, two... take 'em out.
Pietro Maximoff:  This is SHIELD?
Steve Rogers: This is what SHIELD's supposed to be.
Pietro Maximoff: This is not so bad.
Steve Rogers: Let's load 'em up.
Maria Hill: Sir, we have multiple bogies converging on our starboard flank.
Nick Fury: Show 'em what we got.
Maria Hill: You're up.
James Rhodes: Yes! Now this is gonna be a good story.
Tony Stark: Yep. If you live to tell it.
James Rhodes: You think I can't hold my own?
Tony Stark: We get through this, I'll hold your own.
James Rhodes: You had to make it weird.
Clint Barton:  Alright, let's load 'em up! Alright, here we go. Here we go, let's move. Let's go everyone!
Specialist Cameron Klein: Number six boat is topped and locked. Or, uh, or stocked, topped. It... it's, uh, full of people.
Maria Hill: Incoming!
Specialist Cameron Klein: Oh, God!
Ultron:  You think you're saving anyone? I turn that key and drop this rock a little early and it's still billions dead. Even you can't stop that.
Thor: I am Thor, son of Odin, and as long as there is life in my breast, I am...running out of things to say! Are you ready?
Vision: It's terribly well balanced.
Thor: Well, if there's too much weight, you lose power on the swing, so.
Tony Stark: I got it! Create a heat seal. I can...I can supercharge the spire from below.
FRIDAY: Running numbers.  A heat seal could work with enough power.
Tony Stark: Thor, I got a plan!
Thor: We're out of time. They're coming for the core.
Tony Stark: Rhodey, get the rest of the people on board that carrier.
James Rhodes: On it.
Tony Stark: Avengers, time to work for a living.
Pietro Maximoff:  You good?
Wanda Maximoff: Yeah.
Tony Stark: Romanoff? You and Banner better not be playing "hide the zucchini."
Natasha Romanoff: Relax, Shell-head. Not all of us can fly.  What's the drill?
Tony Stark:  This is the drill. If Ultron gets a hand on the core, we lose.
Thor: Is that the best you can do?
Steve Rogers: You had to ask.
Ultron: This is the best I can do. This is exactly what I wanted. All of you, against all of me. How could you possibly hope to stop me?
Tony Stark: Well, like the old man said. Together.
Ultron: You know, with the benefit of hindsight--
Thor: They'll try to leave the city.
Tony Stark: We can't let 'em, not even one. Rhodey!
James Rhodes: I'm on it.  Oh, no, I didn't say you could leave. War Machine, comin' at you, right--  Okay, what?
Steve Rogers: We gotta move out. Even I can tell the air is getting thin. You guys get to the boats, I'll sweep for stragglers, be right behind you.
Clint Barton: What about the core?
Wanda Maximoff: I'll protect it. It's my job.  Get the people on the boats.
Pietro Maximoff: I'm not going to leave you here.
Wanda Maximoff: I can handle this.  Come back for me when everyone else is off, not before.
Pietro Maximoff: Hmm.
Wanda Maximoff: You understand?
Pietro Maximoff: You know, I'm twelve minutes older than you.
Wanda Maximoff:  Go.
FRIDAY: Boss, power levels are way below opt...
Tony Stark: Re-route everything. We get one shot at this.
Clint Barton: I know what I need to do. The dining room! If I knock out that east wall, it'll make a nice work space for Laura, huh? Put up some baffling, she can't hear the kids running around, what do you think?
Natasha Romanoff: You guys always eat in the kitchen anyway.
Clint Barton: No one eats in a dining room.  We don't have a lot of time.
Natasha Romanoff: So get your ass on a boat.  Hey, big guy. Sun's getting real low.
Zrinka: Costel? We were in the market. Costel?!
Tony Stark: Thor, I'm gonna need you back in the church.
Thor:  Is this the last of them?
Steve Rogers: Yeah. Everyone else is on the carrier.
Tony Stark: You know, if this works, we maybe don't walk away.
Thor: Maybe not.
Ultron:  I got no strings, so I have fun. I'm not tied up to anyone.
Pietro Maximoff: You didn't see that coming.
Ultron: Oh, for God's sake!
Clint Barton: No, no. I'm fine.  Oh, it's been a long day.
Ultron: Wanda. If you stay here, you'll die.
Wanda Maximoff: I just did. Do you know how it felt?  It felt like that.
Tony Stark: Thor, on my mark.  Now!
Natasha Romanoff:  Hey, big guy. We did it, the job's finished. Now I need you to turn this bird around, okay? We can't track you in stealth mode, so help me out. I need you t--
Vision: You're afraid.
Ultron: Of you?
Vision: Of death. You're the last one.
Ultron: You were supposed to be the last. Stark asked for a savior, and settled for a slave.
Vision: I suppose we're both disappointments.
Ultron:  I suppose we are.
Vision: Humans are odd. They think order and chaos are somehow opposites, and try to control what won't be. But there is grace in their failings. I think you missed that.
Ultron: They're doomed.
Vision: Yes. But a thing isn't beautiful because it lasts. It's a privilege to be among them.
Ultron: You're unbearably naive.
Vision: Well, I was born yesterday.
Laura Barton:  Say hi to Auntie Nat.
Natasha Romanoff: Fat.
Nick Fury: One of our tech boys flagged this, splashed down in the Banda Sea. Could be the Quinjet. But with Stark's stealth tech, we still can't track the damn thing.
Natasha Romanoff: Right.
Nick Fury: Probably jumped out and swam to Fiji. He'll send a postcard.
Natasha Romanoff: "Wish you were here." You sent me to recruit him, way back when. Did you know then what was going to happen?
Nick Fury: You never know. You hope for the best and make do with what you get. I got a great team.
Natasha Romanoff: Nothing lasts forever.
Nick Fury: Trouble, Miss Romanoff. No matter who wins or loses, trouble still comes around.
Steve Rogers: The rules have changed.
Tony Stark: We're dealing with something new.
Steve Rogers: Well, the Vision's artificial intelligence.
Tony Stark: A machine.
Steve Rogers: So it doesn't count.
Tony Stark: No. It's not like a person lifting the hammer.
Steve Rogers: Right. Different rules for us.
Tony Stark: Nice guy, but artificial.
Steve Rogers: Thank you.
Thor: If he can wield the hammer, he can keep the Mind Stone. It's safe with the Vision and these days, safe is in short supply.
Steve Rogers: But if you put the hammer in an elevator...
Tony Stark: It would still go up.
Steve Rogers: Elevator's not worthy.
Thor: I'm going to miss these little talks of ours.
Tony Stark: Well, not if you don't leave.
Thor: I have no choice. The Mind Stone is the fourth of the Infinity Stones to show up in the last few years. That's not a coincidence. Someone has been playing an intricate game and has made pawns of us. But once all these pieces are in position...
Tony Stark: Triple Yahtzee?
Steve Rogers: You think you can find out what's coming?
Thor: I do.  Besides this one, there's nothing that can't be explained.
Tony Stark: That man has no regard for lawn maintenance. I'm gonna miss him though. And you're gonna miss me. There's gonna be a lot of manful tears.
Steve Rogers: I will miss you, Tony.
Tony Stark: Yeah? Well, it's time for me to tap out. Maybe I should take a page out of Barton's book and build Pepper a farm, hope nobody blows it up.
Steve Rogers: The simple life.
Tony Stark: You'll get there one day.
Steve Rogers: I don't know, family, stability. The guy who wanted all that went in the ice seventy-five years ago. I think someone else came out.
Tony Stark: You alright?
Steve Rogers: I'm home.  You want to keep staring at the wall, or do you want to go to work? I mean, it's a pretty interesting wall.
Natasha Romanoff: I thought you and Tony were still gazing into each other's eyes. How do we look?
Steve Rogers: Well, we're not the '27 Yankees.
Natasha Romanoff: We've got some hitters.
Steve Rogers: They're good. They're not a team.
Natasha Romanoff: Let's beat 'em into shape.
Steve Rogers: Avengers...!
Thanos: Fine, I'll do it myself.
Maria Stark: Try to remember the kind of September. When grass was green . . .  Wake up, dear, and say goodbye to your father.
Howard Stark: Who's the homeless person on the couch?
Young Tony Stark: This is why I love coming home for Christmas . . . right before you leave town.
Maria Stark: Be nice, dear, he's been studying abroad.
Howard Stark: Really, which broad? What's her name?
Young Tony Stark: Candice.
Howard Stark: Do me a favor? Try not to burn the house down before Monday.
Young Tony Stark: Okay, so it's Monday. That is good to know. I will plan my toga party accordingly. Where you going?
Maria Stark: Your father's flying us to the Bahamas for a little getaway.
Howard Stark: We might have to make a quick stop.
Young Tony Stark: At the Pentagon. Right? Don't worry, you're gonna love the holiday menu at the commissary.
Howard Stark: You know, they say sarcasm is a metric for potential. If that's true, you'll be a great man some day. I'll get the bags.
Maria Stark: He does miss you when you are not here. And frankly, you're going to miss us. Because this is the last time we're all going to be together. You know what's about to happen. Say something. If you don't, you'll regret it.
Young Tony Stark: I love you, Dad. And I know you did the best you could.
Tony Stark: That's how I wished it happened. Binarily Augmented Retro-Framing, or BARF. God, I gotta work on that acronym. An extremely costly method of hijacking the hippocampus to . . . clear traumatic memories. Huh.
Tony Stark: It doesn't change the fact that they never made it to the airport . . . or all the things I did to avoid processing my grief, but . . .  Plus, 611 million dollars for my little therapeutic experiment? No one in the right mind would've ever funded it.
Tony Stark: Help me out, what's the MIT mission statement? "To generate, disseminate . . . and preserve knowledge. And work with others . . . to bring it to bear on the world's great challenges." Well, you are the others. And, quiet as it's kept . . . the challenges facing you are the greatest mankind's ever known. Plus, most of you are broke.
Tony Stark: Oh, I'm sorry. Rather, you were. As of this moment . . . every student has been made an equal recipient of the Inaugural September Foundation Grant. As in . . . all of your projects have just been approved and funded.
Tony Stark: No strings, no taxes… just re-frame the future! Starting now.
Tony Stark: Go break some eggs.
MIT teacher: Wow. Wow. That uh . . . that took my breathe away. Oh, Tony! So generous. So much money! Wow! Out of curiosity . . . will any portion of that grant be made available to faculty? I know, "Ooh, gross," but hear me out. I have got this killer idea for a self-cooking hot dog. Basically, chemical detonator embedded . . .
Tony Stark: Restroom's this way, yeah?
MIT teacher: Yeah. Embedded in the meat shaft.
Stark's Assistant: Mr. Stark, I am so sorry about the teleprompter. I didn't know Miss Potts had cancelled. They didn't have time to fix it.
Tony Stark: It's . . . fine. I'll be right back.
MIT teacher: We'll catch up later.
Mrs. Spencer: That was nice, what you did for those young people.
Tony Stark: Ah, they deserve it. Plus, it helps ease my conscience.
Mrs. Spencer: They say there's a correlation between generosity and guilt. But if you've got the money . . . break as many eggs as you like. Right?
Tony Stark: Are you going up?
Mrs. Spencer: I'm right where I want to be.
Tony Stark: Okay, okay. Hey! Sorry, it's an occupational hazard.
Mrs. Spencer: I work for the State Department. Human Resources. I know it's boring . . . but it enabled me to raise a son. I'm very proud of what he grew up to be.
Mrs Spencer: His name was Charlie Spencer. You murdered him. In Sokovia. Not that it matters in the least to you. You think you fight for us. You just fight for yourself.
Mrs Spencer: Who's going to avenge my son, Stark? He's dead . . . and I blame you.
James Rhodes: Secretary Ross has a Congressional Medal of Honor, which is one more than you have.
Sam Wilson: So let's say we agree to this thing. How long is it gonna be before they LoJack us like a bunch of common criminals?
James Rhodes: A 117 countries want to sign this. 117, Sam, and you're just like, "No, that's cool. We got it. "
Sam Wilson: How long are you going to play both sides?
Vision: I have an equation.
Sam Wilson: Oh, this will clear it up.
Vision: In the eight years since Mr. Stark announced himself as Iron Man, the number of known enhanced persons has grown exponentially. And during the same period, the number of potentially world-ending events has risen at a commensurate rate.
Steve Rogers: Are you saying it's our fault?
Vision: I'm saying there may be a causality. Our very strength invites challenge. Challenge incites conflict. And conflict . . . breeds catastrophe. Oversight . . . oversight is not an idea that can be dismissed out of hand.
James Rhodes: Boom.
Natasha Romanoff: Tony. You are being uncharacteristically non-hyper-verbal.
Steve Rogers: It's because he's already made up his mind.
Tony Stark: Boy, you know me so well.
Tony Stark: Actually, I'm nursing an electromagnetic headache.
Tony Stark: That's what's going on, Cap. It's just pain. It's discomfort. Who's putting coffee grounds in the disposal? Am I running a bed and breakfast for a biker gang?
Tony Stark: Oh, that's Charles Spencer, by the way. He's a great kid. Computer engineering degree, 3.6 GPA. Had a floor level gig at Intel planned for the fall. But first, he wanted to put a few miles on his soul, before he parked it behind a desk. See the world. Maybe be of service. Charlie didn't want to go to Vegas or Fort Lauderdale, which is what I would do. He didn't go to Paris or Amsterdam, which sounds fun. He decided to spend his summer building sustainable housing for the poor. Guess where, Sokovia.
Tony Stark: He wanted to make a difference, I suppose. I mean, we won't know because we dropped a building on him while we were kicking ass.
Tony Stark: There's no decision-making process here. We need to be put in check! Whatever form that takes, I'm game. If we can't accept limitations, if we're boundary-less, we're no better than the bad guys.
Steve Rogers: Tony, someone dies on your watch, you don't give up.
Tony Stark: Who said we're giving up?
Steve Rogers: We are if we're not taking responsibility for our actions. This document just shifts the blames.
James Rhodes: I'm sorry. Steve. That - that is dangerously arrogant. This is the United Nations we're talking about. It's not the World Security Council, it's not SHIELD, it's not HYDRA.
Steve Rogers: No, but it's run by people with agendas, and agendas change.
Tony Stark: That's good. That's why I'm here. When I realized what my weapons were capable of in the wrong hands, I shut it down and stop manufacturing.
Steve Rogers: Tony, you chose to do that. If we sign this, we surrender our right to choose. What if this panel sends us somewhere we don't think we should go? What if there is somewhere we need to go, and they don't let us? We may not be perfect, but the safest hands are still our own.
Tony Stark: If we don't do this now, it's gonna be done to us later. That's the fact. That won't be pretty.
Wanda Maximoff: You're saying they'll come for me.
Vision: We would protect you.
Natasha Romanoff: Maybe Tony's right.
Natasha Romanoff: If we have one hand on the wheel, we can still steer. If we take it off -
Sam Wilson: Aren't you the same woman who told the government to kiss her ass a few years ago?
Natasha Romanoff: I'm just . . . I'm reading the terrain. We have made . . . some very public mistakes. We need to win their trust back.
Tony Stark: Focus up. I'm sorry, did I just mishear you or did you agree with me?
Natasha Romanoff: Oh, I want to take it back now.
Tony Stark: No, no, no. You can't retract it. Thank you. Unprecedented. Okay, case closed--I win.
Steve Rogers: I have to go.
Steve Rogers: What's gonna happen to him?
Everett Ross: Same thing that ought to happen to you. Psychological evaluation and extradition.
Sharon Carter: This is Everett Ross, Deputy Task Force Commander.
Steve Rogers: What about our lawyer?
Everett Ross: Lawyer. That's funny. See their weapons are placed in lockup. Oh, we'll write you a receipt.
Sam Wilson: I better not look out the window and see anybody flying around in that.
Everett Ross: You'll be provided with an office instead of a cell. Now, do me a favor, stay in it?
T'Challa: I don't intend on going anywhere.
Natasha Romanoff: For the record, this is what making things worse looks like.
Steve Rogers: He's alive.
Tony Stark:  No. Romania was not Accords-sanctioned. And, Colonel Rhodes is supervising cleanup.
Natasha Romanoff: Try not to break anything while we fix this.
Tony Stark:  Consequences? You bet there'll be consequences. Obviously you can quote me on that 'cause I just said it. Anything else? Thank you, sir.
Steve Rogers: 'Consequences'?
Tony Stark: Secretary Ross wants you both prosecuted. Had to give him something.
Steve Rogers: I'm not getting that shield back, am I?
Natasha Romanoff: Technically, it's the government's property. Wings, too.
Sam Wilson: That's cold.
Tony Stark: Warmer than jail.
Delivery Truck Driver: Das kann nicht richtig sein. Was zum Teufel?
Tony Stark: Hey, you wanna see something cool? I pulled something from Dad's archives. Felt timely.  FDR signed the Lend-Lease bill with these in 1941. Provided support to the Allies when they needed it most.
Steve Rogers: Some would say it brought our country closer to war.
Tony Stark: See? If not for these, you wouldn't be here. I'm trying to . . . what do you call it? That's an olive branch. Is that what you call it?
Steve Rogers: Is Pepper here? I didn't see her.
Tony Stark: We're kinda . . . well, not kinda . . .
Steve Rogers: Pregnant?
Tony Stark: No. Definitely not. We're taking a break. It's nobody's fault.
Steve Rogers: I'm so sorry, Tony. I didn't know.
Tony Stark: A few years ago, I almost lost her, so I trashed all my suits. Then, we had to mop up HYDRA . . . and then Ultron. My fault. And then, and then, and then, I never stopped. Because the truth is I don't wanna stop. I don't wanna lose her. I thought maybe the Accords could split the difference.  In her defense, I'm a handful. Yet, Dad was a pain in the ass, but he and Mom always made it work.
Steve Rogers: You know, I'm glad Howard got married. I only knew him when he was young and single.
Tony Stark: Oh, really? You two knew each other? He never mentioned that. Maybe only a thousand times. God, I hated you.
Steve Rogers: I don't mean to make things difficult.
Tony Stark: I know, because you're a very polite person.
Steve Rogers: If I see a situation pointed south . . . I can't ignore it. Sometimes I wish I could.
Tony Stark: No, you don't.
Steve Rogers:  No, I don't. Sometimes . . .
Tony Stark: Sometimes I wanna punch you in your perfect teeth. But I don't wanna see you gone. We need you, Cap. So far, nothing's happened that can't be undone, if you sign. We can make the last 24 hours legit. Barnes gets transferred to an American psych-center . . . instead of a Wakandan prison.
Steve Rogers:  I'm not saying it's impossible, but there would have to be safeguards.
Tony Stark: Sure. Once we put out the PR fire, those documents can be amended. I'd file a motion to have you and Wanda reinstated . . .
Steve Rogers: Wanda? What about Wanda?
Tony Stark: She's fine. She's confined to the compound, currently. Vision's keeping her company.
Steve Rogers: Oh God, Tony! Every time. Every time I think you see things the right way . . .
Tony Stark: What? It's a 100 acres with a lap pool. It's got a screening room. There's worse ways to protect people.
Steve Rogers: Protection? Is that how you see this? This is protection? It's internment, Tony.
Tony Stark: She's not a US citizen.
Steve Rogers: Oh, come on, Tony.
Tony Stark: And they don't grant visas to weapons of mass destruction.
Steve Rogers: She's a kid!
Tony Stark: GIVE ME A BREAK! I'm doing what has to be done . . . to stave off something worse.
Steve Rogers:  You keep telling yourself that.  Hate to break up the set.
Helmut Zemo:  Hello, Mr. Barnes. I've been sent by the United Nations to evaluate you. Do you mind if I sit? Your first name is James?
Sharon Carter:  The receipt for your gear.
Sam Wilson: 'Bird costume'? Come on.
Sharon Carter: I didn't write it.
Helmut Zemo: I'm not here to judge you. I just want to ask you a few questions. Do you know where you are, James? I can't help you if you don't talk to me, James.
Bucky Barnes: My name is Bucky.
Delivery Truck Driver: Hallo?  Hello?)  Hey. Ich hab eine große für dich.  Hey. I have a big one for you.)  Ja. Okay, hier unterzeichnen.
Custodian: Hier?
Delivery Truck Driver: Ja.
Steve Rogers: Why would the Task Force release this photo to begin with?
Sharon Carter: Get the word out, involve as many eyes as we can?
Steve Rogers: Right. It's a good way to flush a guy out of hiding. Set off a bomb, get your picture taken. Get seven billion people looking for the Winter Soldier.
Sharon Carter: You're saying someone framed him to find him.
Sam Wilson: Steve, we looked for the guy for two years and found nothing.
Steve Rogers: We didn't bomb the UN. That turns a lot of heads.
Sharon Carter: Yeah, but that doesn't guarantee that whoever framed him would get him. It guarantees that we would.
Steve Rogers:  Yeah.
Helmut Zemo:  Tell me, Bucky. You've seen a great deal, haven't you?
Bucky Barnes: I don't want to talk about it.
Helmut Zemo: You fear that… if you open your mouth, the horrors might never stop. Don't worry.  We only have to talk about one.
Custodian: Hey, was ist das?
Delivery Truck Driver: Ich weiß es nicht.
Everett Ross: Great. Come on, guys, get me eyes on Barnes. Go.
Tony Stark: FRIDAY, get me the source of that outage.
Sharon Carter:  Sub-level 5, east wing.
Bucky Barnes: What the hell is this?
Helmut Zemo: Why don't we discuss your home? Not Romania. Certainly not Brooklyn, no. I mean, your real home.  Желание.  Longing.)
Bucky Barnes:  No.
Helmut Zemo: Ржавый.  Rusted.)
Bucky Barnes: Stop.
Helmut Zemo: Семнадцать.  Seventeen.)
Bucky Barnes:  Stop.
Helmut Zemo: Рассвет.  Daybreak.)
Helmut Zemo: Печь.  Furnace.) Девять.  Nine.)
Helmut Zemo: Добросердечный.  Benign.)
Helmut Zemo: Возвращение на Родину.  Homecoming.) Один.  One.) Грузовой вагон.  Freight car.)
Helmut Zemo: Солдат?  Soldier?)
Bucky Barnes: Я готов отвечать.  Ready to comply.)
Helmut Zemo: Mission report. December 16, 1991.
Helmut Zemo: Help me. Help.
Steve Rogers:  Get up.  Who are you? What do you want?
Helmut Zemo: To see an empire fall.
Man on PA #1: Der Ostflügel ist kompromittiert. Ich wiederhole: Der Ostflügel ist kompromittiert.
Sam Wilson: Hey.
Everett Ross: Evac all civilians. Get me a perimeter around the building, and gunships in the air.
Natasha Romanoff: Please tell me you brought a suit.
Tony Stark: Sure did. It's a lovely Tom Ford, three-piece, two-button. I'm an active-duty non-combatant.
Sharon Carter: Follow me.
Natasha Romanoff:  We're in position.
Natasha Romanoff: You could at least recognize me.
Sam Wilson: Damn it.
Zemo's Wife: He asked me again if you were going to be there. I said I wasn't sure. You should've seen his little face. Just try, okay? I'm going to bed. I love you.
News anchor #5: James Barnes, der mit dem Bombenanschlag auf die UN in Wien in Verbindung gebracht wird, ist heute aus der Haft entflohen. Ebenfalls vermisst werden die Avengers Captain Steve Rogers und Sam Wilson.  James Barnes, the suspect in the UN Vienna bombing escaped custody today. Also missing Avenger Captain Steve Rogers and Sam Wilson.)
Sam Wilson: Hey, Cap!
Bucky Barnes: Steve.
Steve Rogers: Which Bucky am I talking to?
Bucky Barnes: Your mom's name was Sarah...You used to wear newspapers in your shoes.
Steve Rogers: Can't read that in a museum.
Sam Wilson: Just like that, we're suppose to be cool?
Bucky Barnes: What did I do?
Steve Rogers: Enough.
Bucky Barnes: Oh, God, I knew this would happen. Everything HYDRA put inside me is still there. All he had to do was say the goddamn words.
Steve Rogers: Who was he?
Bucky Barnes: I don't know.
Steve Rogers: People are dead. The bombing, the setup. The doctor did all that just to get 10 minutes with you. I need you to do better than "I don't know."
Bucky Barnes: He wanted to know about Siberia. Where I was kept. He wanted to know exactly where.
Steve Rogers: Why would he need to know that?
Bucky Barnes: Because I'm not the only Winter Soldier.
Josef / Super Soldier #1: It hurts!
[Bucky and Josef fight each other in a barred chamber. The four others who were given the blue liquid are there. Josef kicks with enormous power, sending Bucky flying. Watching Karpov folds his arms.
Vasily Karpov: Очень хорошо, Иосиф.  Good work.)
Vasily Karpov: Солдат, вытащи меня отсюда!  Get me out of here.)
Steve Rogers: Who were they?
Bucky Barnes: Their most elite death squad. More kills than anyone in HYDRA history. And that was before the serum.
Sam Wilson: They all turn out like you?
Bucky Barnes: Worse.
Steve Rogers: The doctor, could he control them?
Bucky Barnes: Enough.
Steve Rogers: Said he wanted to see an empire fall.
Bucky Barnes: With these guys he could do it. They speak 30 languages, can hide in plain sight, infiltrate, assassinate, destabilize, They can take a whole country down in one night. You'd never see them coming.
Sam Wilson:  This would have been a lot easier a week ago.
Steve Rogers: If we call Tony . . .
Sam Wilson: No, he won't believe us.
Steve Rogers: Even if he did . . .
Sam Wilson: Who knows if the Accords would let him help.
Steve Rogers: We're on our own.
Sam Wilson: Maybe not. I know a guy.
Secretary Ross: I don't suppose you have any idea where they are?
Tony Stark: We will. GSG-9's got the borders covered. Recon's flying 24/7. They'll get a hit. We'll handle it.
Secretary Ross: You don't get it, Stark. It's not yours to handle. It's clear you can't be objective. I'm putting Special Ops on this.
Natasha Romanoff: What happens when the shooting starts? What, do you kill Steve Rogers?
Secretary Ross: If we're provoked. Barnes would've been eliminated in Romania if it wasn't for Rogers. There are dead people who would be alive now. Feel free to check my math.
Tony Stark: All due respect, you're not going to solve this with boys in bullets, Ross. You gotta let us bring them in.
Secretary Ross: How would that end any differently from the last time?
Tony Stark: Because this time, I won't be wearing loafers and a silk shirt. 72 hours, guaranteed.
Secretary Ross: 36 hours. Barnes. Rogers. Wilson.
Tony Stark: Thank you, sir.  My left arm is numb, is that normal?
Natasha Romanoff:  You alright?
Tony Stark: Always.  36 hours, jeez.
Natasha Romanoff: We're seriously understaffed.
Tony Stark: Oh, yeah. It'd be great if we had a Hulk right about now. Any shot?
Natasha Romanoff: No. You really think he'd be on our side?
Tony Stark: No.
Natasha Romanoff: I have an idea.
Tony Stark: Me too. Where's yours?
Natasha Romanoff: Downstairs. Where's yours?
Peter Parker: Hey, May.
May Parker: Mmm. Hey. How was school today?
Peter Parker: Okay. This crazy car parked outside . . .
Tony Stark: Oh, Mr. Parker.
Peter Parker: Um . . .  What--what are you doing . . .? Hey! Uh, I'm--Im--I'm Peter.
Tony Stark: Tony.
Peter Parker: What are . . .what are you--what are you--what are you doing here?
Tony Stark: It's about time we met. You've been getting my e-mails, right?
Peter Parker: Yeah. Yeah.
Tony Stark: Right?
Peter Parker: Regarding the . . .
May Parker: You didn't tell me about the grant.
Peter Parker: About the grant.
Tony Stark: The September Foundation.
Peter Parker: Right.
Tony Stark: Yeah. Remember when you applied?
Peter Parker: Yeah.
Tony Stark: I approved, so now we're in business.
May Parker: You didn't tell me anything. What's up with that? You keeping secrets from me now?
Peter Parker: Why, I just, I just . . . I just know how much you love surprises, so I thought I would let you know . . . wh . . . anyway, what did I apply for?
Tony Stark: That's what I'm here to hash out.
Peter Parker: Okay. Hash, hash out, okay.
Tony Stark: It's so hard for me to believe that she's someone's aunt.
May Parker: Yeah, well, we come in all shapes and sizes, you know?
Tony Stark: This walnut date loaf is exceptional.
Peter Parker: Let me just stop you there.
Tony Stark: Yeah?
Peter Parker: Is this grant, like, got money involved or whatever? No?
Tony Stark: Yeah.
Peter Parker: Yeah?
Tony Stark: It's pretty well funded.
Peter Parker: Wow.
Tony Stark: Look who you're talking to. Can I have 5 minutes with him?
May Parker: Sure.
Tony Stark:  As walnut date loaves go, that wasn't bad.  Whoa, what do we have here? Retro tech, huh? Thrift store? Salvation Army?
Peter Parker: Uh, the garbage, actually.
Tony Stark: You're a dumpster diver.
Peter Parker: Yeah, I was . . . anyway, look, um, I definitely did not apply for your grant.
Tony Stark: Ah-ah! Me first.
Peter Parker: Okay.
Tony Stark: Quick question of the rhetorical variety.  That's you, right?
Peter Parker: Um, no. What do you. What do you mean?
Tony Stark: Yeah. Look at you go. Wow! Nice catch. 3,000 pounds, 40 miles an hour. That's not easy. You got mad skills.
Peter Parker: That's all- That's all on YouTube, though, right? I mean, that's where you found that? Because you know that's all fake. It's all done on the computer.
Tony Stark: Mm-Hmm.
Peter Parker: It's like that video. What is it?
Tony Stark: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah . . . oh, you mean like those UFOs over Phoenix?
Peter Parker: Exactly.
Tony Stark: Oh, what have we here?
Peter Parker:  Uh . . . that's a . . .
Tony Stark: So. You're the . . . Spider . . . ling. Crime-fighting Spider . . .you're Spider-Boy?
Peter Parker:  S . . . Spider-Man.
Tony Stark: Not in that onesie, you're not.
Peter Parker: It's not a onesie.  I don't believe this. I was actually having a real good day today, you know, Mr. Stark. Didn't miss my train, this perfectly good DVD player was just sitting there and . . . Algebra test. Nailed it!
Tony Stark: Who else knows? Anybody?
Peter Parker: Nobody.
Tony Stark: Not even your . . . unusually attractive aunt?
Peter Parker: No. No, no. No, no. If she knew, she would freak out. And when she freaks out, I freak out.
Tony Stark: You know what I think is really cool? This webbing. That tensile strength is off the charts. Who manufactured that?
Peter Parker: I did.
Tony Stark: Climbing the walls, how you doing that? Adhesive gloves?
Peter Parker: It's a long story. I was uh . . .
Tony Stark: Lordy! Can you even see in these?
Peter Parker: Yes. Yes, I can! I can. I can-I can see in those. Okay? It's just that… when whatever happened, happened . . . it's like my senses have been dialed to 11. There's way too much input, so . . . they just kinda help me focus.
Tony Stark: You're in dire need of an upgrade. Systemic, top to bottom. 100-point restoration. That's why I'm here.  Why you doing this? I gotta know. What's your MO? What gets you outta that twin bed in the morning?
Peter Parker: Because . . .  because l've been me my whole life, and l've had these powers for 6 months.
Tony Stark: Mm-Hmm.
Peter Parker: I read books, I build computers . . . and--and yeah. I would love to play football. But I couldn't then so I shouldn't now.
Tony Stark: Sure, because you're different.
Peter Parker: Exactly. But I can't tell anybody that, so I'm not. When you can do the things that I can, but you don't . . .  and then the bad things happen . . . they happen because of you.
Tony Stark:  So you wanna look out for the little guy? You wanna do your part? Make the world a better place, all that, right?
Peter Parker: Yeah. Yeah just looking out . . . for the little guy. That's--that's what it is.
Tony Stark:  I'm gonna sit here, so you move the leg.  You got a passport?
Peter Parker: Uh, no. I don't even have a driver's license.
Tony Stark: You ever been to Germany?
Peter Parker: No.
Tony Stark: Oh, you'll love it.
Peter Parker: I can't go to Germany!
Tony Stark: Why?
Peter Parker: I got . . . homework.
Tony Stark: I'm gonna pretend you didn't say that.
Peter Parker: I'm---I'm being serious! I can't just drop out of school!
Tony Stark: Might be a little dangerous. Better tell Aunt Hottie I'm taking you on a field trip.
Peter Parker:  Don't tell Aunt May.
Tony Stark: Alright, Spider-Man.  Get me out of this.
Peter Parker: Sorry, I'll get the . . .
Wanda Maximoff: What is it?
Vision: Stay here, please.
Clint Barton: Guess I shoulda knocked.
Wanda Maximoff: Oh my god! What are you doing here?
Clint Barton: Disappointing my kids.  I'm supposed to go water-skiing. Cap needs our help. Come on.
Vision: Clint!  You should not be here.
Clint Barton:  Really? I retire for, what, like five minutes, and it all goes to shit.
Vision: Please consider the consequences of your actions.
Clint Barton: Okay, they're considered. Okay, we gotta go.  It's this way.
Wanda Maximoff: I've caused enough problems.
Clint Barton:  You gotta help me, Wanda. Look, you wanna mope, can go to high school. You wanna make amends, you get off your ass. Shit.  I knew I should've stretched.
Vision: Clint, you can't overpower me.
Clint Barton: I know I can't. But she can.
Wanda Maximoff: Vision, that's enough. Let him go. I'm leaving.
Vision: I can't let you.
Wanda Maximoff:  I'm sorry.
Vision:  If you do this . . . they will never stop being afraid of you.
Wanda Maximoff: I can't control their fear, only my own.
Clint Barton: Oh . . . come on. We got one more stop.
Attache: It's just a matter of time. Our satellites are running facial, bio-metric, and behavioral pattern scans.
Security Chief:  Move, or you will be moved.
T'Challa: As entertaining as that would be . . .
Natasha Romanoff: You really think you can find him?
T'Challa: My resources are considerable.
Natasha Romanoff: Yeah, it took the world 70 years to find Barnes . . . so you could probably do that in about half the time.
T'Challa: You know where they are.
Natasha Romanoff: I know someone who does.
Sharon Carter: Not sure you understand the concept of a getaway car.
Steve Rogers: It's low profile.
Sharon Carter: Good, because this stuff tends to draw a crowd.
Bucky Barnes:  Can you move your seat up?
Sam Wilson: No.
Steve Rogers: I owe you again.
Sharon Carter: Keeping a list.  You know, he kinda tried to kill me.
Steve Rogers: Sorry. I'll put it on the list, too. They're going to come looking for you.
Sharon Carter: I know.
Steve Rogers: Thank you, Sharon.
Sharon Carter: That was . . .
Steve Rogers: Late.
Sharon Carter: Damn right. I should go.
Steve Rogers: Okay.
Clint Barton: Cap.
Steve Rogers: You know I wouldn't have called If I had any other choice.
Clint Barton: Hey man, you're doing me a favor. Besides, I owe a debt.
Steve Rogers: Thanks for having my back.
Wanda Maximoff: It was time to get off my ass.
Steve Rogers: How about our other recruit?
Clint Barton: He's rarin' to go. Had to put a little coffee in him, but… he should be good.
Scott Lang: What timezone is this?
Clint Barton: Come on. Come on.
Scott Lang:  Captain America.
Steve Rogers: Mr. Lang.
Scott Lang: It's an honor. I'm shaking your hand too long. Wow! This is awesome! Captain America.  I know you, too. You're great!  Jeez. Ah, look, I wanna say, I know you know a lot of super people, so . . . thinks for thanking of me.  To Sam.] Hey, man!
Sam Wilson: What's up, Tic Tac?
Scott Lang: Uh, good to see you. Look, what happened last time when I . . .
Sam Wilson: It was a great audition, but it'll . . . it'll never happen again.
Steve Rogers: They tell you what we're up against?
Scott Lang: Something about some . . . psycho-assassins?
Steve Rogers: We're outside the law on this one. So, if you come with us, you're a wanted man.
Scott Lang: Yeah, well, what else is new?
Bucky Barnes: We should get moving.
Clint Barton: We got a chopper lined up.
Man on PA #2: Dies ist eine Notsituation. Alle Passagiere müssen den Flughafen sofort evakuieren.
Bucky Barnes: They're evacuating the airport.
Sam Wilson: Stark.
Scott Lang: Stark?
Steve Rogers: Suit up.
Tony Stark: Wow, it's so weird how you run into people at the airport. Don't you think that's weird?
James Rhodes: Definitely weird.
Steve Rogers: Hear me out, Tony. That doctor, the psychiatrist, he's behind all of this.
T'Challa:  Captain.
Steve Rogers: Your highness.
Tony Stark: Anyway, Ross gave me 36 hours to bring you in. That was 24 hours ago. Can you help a brother out?
Steve Rogers: You're after the wrong guy.
Tony Stark: Your judgment is askew. Your old war buddy killed innocent people yesterday.
Steve Rogers: And there are five more super soldiers just like him. I can't let the doctor find them first, Tony. I can't.
Natasha Romanoff: Steve . . . you know what's about to happen. Do you really wanna punch your way out of this one?
Tony Stark: All right, I've run out of patience. Underoos!  Nice job, kid.
Peter Parker: Thanks. Well, I could've stuck the landing a little better. It's just the new suit… Well, it's nothing, Mr. Stark. It's--it's perfect. Thank you.
Tony Stark: Yeah, we don't really need to start a conversation.
Peter Parker: Okay. Cap . . . Captain. Big fan, I'm Spider-Man.
Tony Stark: Yeah, we'll talk about it later. Just . . .
Peter Parker: Hey, everyone.
Tony Stark: . . . Good job.
Steve Rogers: You've been busy.
Tony Stark: And you've been a complete idiot. Dragging in Clint. 'Rescuing' Wanda from a place she doesn't even want to leave, a safe place. I'm trying to keep . . . I'm trying to keep you from tearing the Avengers apart.
Steve Rogers: You did that when you signed.
Tony Stark: Alright, We're done. You're gonna turn Barnes over, you're gonna come with us. NOW! Because it's us! Or a squad of J-SOC guys . . . with no compunction about being impolite.  Come on.
Sam Wilson:  We found it. Their Quinjet's in hanger five, north runway.
Steve Rogers:  Alright, Lang.
Peter Parker: Hey, guys, something . . .
James Rhodes: Whoa. What--what the hell was that?
Scott Lang:  I believe this is yours, Captain America.
Tony Stark: Oh, great. Alright, there's two on the parking deck. One of them's Maximoff, I'm gonna grab her. Rhodey, you want to take Cap?
James Rhodes: Got two in the terminal, Wilson and Barnes.
T'Challa: Barnes is mine!
Peter Parker: Hey, Mr. Stark, what should I do?
Tony Stark: What we discussed. Keep your distance. Web 'em up.
Peter Parker: Okay, copy that!
T'Challa: Move, Captain. I won't ask a second time.
Scott Lang:  Look, I really don't want to hurt you.
Natasha Romanoff: I wouldn't stress about it.
Bucky Barnes:  What the hell is that?
Sam Wilson: Everyone's got a gimmick now.
Peter Parker:  You have a metal arm? That is awesome, dude!  You have the right to remain silent!
James Rhodes: Sorry, Cap. This won't kill you but it ain't gonna tickle either.
Tony Stark:  Wanda, I think you hurt Vision's feelings.
Wanda Maximoff: You locked me in my room.
Tony Stark: Okay. First, that's an exaggeration. Second, I did it to protect you. Hey, Clint.
Clint Barton: Hey, man.
Tony Stark: Clearly, retirement doesn't suit you. You got tired of shooting golf?
Clint Barton: Well, I played 18, I shot 18. Just can't seem to miss.
Tony Stark: First time for everything.
Clint Barton: Made you look.
FRIDAY: Multiple contusions detected.
Tony Stark: Yeah, I detected that too.
Peter Parker: Oh god.  Hey buddy, I think you lost this!  Those wings carbon fiber?
Sam Wilson: Is this stuff coming out of you?
Peter Parker: That would explain the rigidity-flexibility ratio, which, gotta say, that's awesome, man.
Sam Wilson: I don't know if you've been a fight before but there's usually not this much talking.
Peter Parker: Alright, sorry, my bad.  Guys, look. I'd love to keep this up but I've only got one job here today and I gotta impress Mr. Stark, so, l'm really sorry.  Wwahhhh!
Bucky Barnes: You couldn't have done that earlier?
Sam Wilson: I hate you.
James Rhodes: Great.
Scott Lang: Hey, Cap, heads up!  Throw it at this. Now!
James Rhodes: Oh, come on!
Scott Lang: Oh, man. I thought it was a water truck. Uh . . . sorry.
James Rhodes: Alright. Now, I'm pissed.
Natasha Romanoff:  Is this, part of the plan?
Tony Stark: Well, my plan was to go easy on them. You wanna switch it up?
Clint Barton:  There's our ride.
Steve Rogers: Come on!
Vision: Captain Rogers. I know you believe what you're doing is right. But for the collective good you must surrender now.
Sam Wilson: What do we do, Cap?
Steve Rogers: We fight.
Natasha Romanoff: This is gonna end well.
Peter Parker: They're not stopping.
Tony Stark: Neither are we.
Natasha Romanoff: We're still friends, right?
Clint Barton: Depends on how hard you hit me.
Wanda Maximoff: You were pulling your punches.
Bucky Barnes:  I didn't kill your father.
T'Challa: Then why did you run?
Peter Parker: That thing does not obey the laws of physics at all.
Steve Rogers: Look kid. There's a lot going on here that you don't understand.
Peter Parker: Mr. Stark said you'd say that. Wow.  He also said to go for your legs.
Sam Wilson:  Clint, can you get him off me?
Clint Barton: Buckled in?
Scott Lang: Yeah. No, I'm good. I'm good, Arrow Guy. Let's go. Let's go!
Steve Rogers:  Stark tell you anything else?
Peter Parker: That you're wrong. You think you're right. That makes you dangerous.
Steve Rogers: Guess he had a point.  You got heart, kid. Where're you from?
Peter Parker: Queens.
Steve Rogers: Brooklyn.
Tony Stark:  Friday?
FRIDAY: We have some weapon systems offline.
Tony Stark: They what?
Scott Lang: Oh, you're gonna have to take this into the shop.
Tony Stark: Who's speaking?
Scott Lang: It's your conscience. We don't talk a lot these days.
Tony Stark: Friday?
FRIDAY: Deploying fire suppression system.
Scott Lang: Uh -oh. Oh boy. Whoa!
Bucky Barnes:  We gotta go. That guy's probably in Siberia by now.
Steve Rogers: We gotta draw out the flyers. I'll take Vision. You get to the jet.
Sam Wilson: No, you get to the jet! Both of you!  The rest of us aren't getting out of here.
Clint Barton: As much as I hate to admit it, if we're gonna win this one, some of us might have to lose it.
Sam Wilson: This isn't the real fight, Steve.
Steve Rogers: Alright, Sam, what's the play?
Sam Wilson: We need a diversion, something big.
Scott Lang: I got something kind of big, but I can't hold it very long. On my signal, run like hell. And if I tear myself in half . . . don't come back for me.
Bucky Barnes: He's gonna tear himself in half?
Steve Rogers: You're sure about this, Scott?
Scott Lang: I do it all the time. I mean once . . . in a lab. Then I passed out. I'm the boss. I'm the boss. I'm the boss. I'm the boss. I'm the BOSS!
Peter Parker: Holy shit!
James Rhodes: Okay, tiny dude is big now. He's big now.
Steve Rogers: I guess that's the signal.
Sam Wilson: Way to go, Tic Tac!
Tony Stark: Give me back my Rhodey.
Peter Parker: I got him!
Tony Stark: Okay, anybody on our side hiding any shocking and fantastic abilities they'd like to disclose, I'm open to suggestion.
Scott Lang: You wanna get to them… you gotta go through me.
Clint Barton: We haven't met yet.  I'm Clint.
T'Challa: I don't care.
James Rhodes: Ahhh!
Scott Lang: Get off.
Natasha Romanoff: You're not gonna stop.
Steve Rogers: You know I can't.
Natasha Romanoff: I'm gonna regret this.  Go.
Peter Parker:  Hey, guys, you ever see that really old movie, Empire Strikes Back?
James Rhodes: Jesus, Tony, how old is this guy?
Tony Stark: I don't know, I didn't carbon-date him. He's on the young side.
Peter Parker:  You know that part . . . where they're on the snow planet . . . with the walking thingies?
Tony Stark: Maybe the kid's on to something.
James Rhodes: High now, Tony. Go high.
Peter Parker:  YES! Ha ha! That was awesome!
Scott Lang: Does anyone have any orange slices?
Tony Stark:  Kid, you alright?
Peter Parker: Hey! Get off me!
Tony Stark: Same side. Guess who. Hi. It's me.
Peter Parker: Oh. Hey, man.
Tony Stark: Yeah.
Peter Parker: That was scary.
Tony Stark: Yeah. You're done. Alright?
Peter Parker: What?
Tony Stark: You did a good job. Stay down.
Peter Parker: No, I'm good. I'm fine.
Tony Stark: Stay down.
Peter Parker: No, it's good I gotta get him back!
Tony Stark: You're going home or I'll call Aunt May! You're done!
Peter Parker: Wait. Mr. Stark, wait! I'm not done, I'm not . . .  Okay, I'm done. I'm done.
Natasha Romanoff:  I said I'd help you find him, not catch him. There's a difference.
Vision:  I'm sorry.
Wanda Maximoff: Me, too.
Vision: It's as I said. Catastrophe.
James Rhodes: Vision, I got a bandit on my six.  Vision! You copy? Target his thrusters, turn him into a glider.
Tony Stark: Rhodey!
James Rhodes: Tony, I'm flying dead stick.
Tony Stark: RHODES!  Read vitals.
FRIDAY: Heartbeat detected. Emergency medical is on its way.
Sam Wilson:  I'm sorry.
German Innkeeper: Guten Morgen, Zimmerservice?
Helmut Zemo: Guten Morgen Frau Leiber. Zimmer 201 hier  This is room 201.)
German Innkeeper: Ah, Herr Müller. Speck und schwarzer Kaffee für Sie, ja?  Bacon and black coffee again today?)
Helmut Zemo: Wie gut Sie mich kennen.  You know me so well.)
German Innkeeper: Hallo? Ihr Frühstück ist hier. Darf ich mich reinlassen? Herr Müller? Herr Müller? Oh mein Gott!  Hello? Your breakfast is here. May I let myself in? Mr Müller? Mr Müller? Oh God!)
Bucky Barnes: What's gonna happen to your friends?
Steve Rogers:  Whatever it is… I'll deal with it.
Bucky Barnes:  I don't know if I'm worth all this, Steve.
Steve Rogers:  What you did all those years . . . it wasn't you. You didn't have a choice.
Bucky Barnes: I know. But I did it.
Tony Stark: How did this happen?
Vision: I became distracted.
Tony Stark: I didn't think that was possible.
Vision: Neither did I.
Tony Stark: The doctors say he shattered L4 through S1. Extreme laceration in the spinal cord. Probably looking at some form of paralysis.
Natasha Romanoff: Steve's not gonna stop. If you don't either, Rhodey's gonna be the best case scenario.
Tony Stark: You let them go, Nat.
Natasha Romanoff: We played this wrong.
Tony Stark: 'We'? Boy, it must be hard to shake the whole double agent thing, huh? It sticks in the DNA.
Natasha Romanoff: Are you incapable of letting go of your ego for one goddamn second?
Tony Stark: T'Challa told Ross what you did, so . . . they're coming for you.
Natasha Romanoff: I'm not the one that needs to watch their back.
Tony Stark:  What am I looking at, Friday?
FRIDAY: Priority upload from Berlin police.
Tony Stark: Fire up the chopper.
FRIDAY: The Task Force called for a psychiatrist as soon as Barnes was captured. The UN dispatched Dr. Theo Broussard from Geneva within the hour. He was met by this man.
Tony Stark: Did you run facial recognition yet?
FRIDAY: What do I look like?
Tony Stark: Uh, I don't know. I've been picturing a red head.
FRIDAY: You must be thinking of someone else.
Tony Stark: Must be.
FRIDAY: The fake doctor is actually Colonel Helmut Zemo, Sokovian Intelligence.  Zemo ran Echo Skorpion, a Sokovian covert kill squad.
Tony Stark: So, what happened to the real Broussard?
FRIDAY: He was found dead in a Berlin hotel room. Where police also found a wig and facial prosthesis approximating the appearance of one James Buchanan Barnes.
Tony Stark: Son of a bitch. Get this to Ross.
FRIDAY: Yes, Boss.
[A wide and flat, snow covered landscape. A mountain looms on the horizon. A caterpillar truck stops on the windswept mountain plateau. Zemo gets out of the vehicle. Set on rocks is an entrance with huge, rusted double doors. Zemo hacks away at the wall beside the doors. he uncovers a control panel and keys in a code whilst referring to the red book. The huge, curved double doors break open a crack. Zemo pulls them open wider. He shines a flash light and pulls down the hood of his coat.
Inside is a vast, gloomy space cramped with shelves stacked with filing boxes. Zemo moves a ladder along and searches the boxes. he climbs up the ladder and removes a filing box labeled: 'декабря 1991' .
Zemo walks along a tunnel which opens into a cavernous chamber with a high ceiling. He carries a VHS cassette and a flash light. Standing around the chamber a five large, clear sided capsules. They glow a gold yellow inside. Frowning Zemo walks up to one of the capsules and shines his flash light inside. In the capsule, motionless in a state of suspended animation is the enhanced soldier Josef.]
Guard:  This is the Raft Prison Control. You're clear for landing, Mr. Stark.
Tony Stark: So? You got the files? Let's reroute the satellites, start facial scanning for this Zemo guy.
Secretary Ross: You seriously think I'm gonna listen to you after that fiasco in Leipzig? You're lucky you're not in one of these cells.
Clint Barton:  The Futurist, gentlemen! The Futurist is here! He sees all! He knows what's best for you, whether your like it or not.
Tony Stark: Give me a break, Barton. I had no idea they'll put you here. Come on.
Clint Barton:  Yeah, well, you knew they'd put us somewhere, Tony.
Tony Stark: Yeah, but not some super-max floating ocean pokey. You know, this place is for maniacs. This is a place for . . .
Clint Barton: Criminals?  Criminals, Tony. Think that's the word you're looking for.  Right? That didn't used to mean me. Or Sam, or Wanda. But here we are.
Tony Stark: Because you broke the law.
Clint Barton: Yeah.
Tony Stark: I didn't make you.
Clint Barton: La, la, la, la, la . . .
Tony Stark: You read it, you broke it.
Clint Barton: La, la, la, la la…
Tony Stark: Alright, you're all grown up, you got a wife and kids. I don't understand, why didn't you think about them before you chose the wrong side?
Clint Barton: You gotta watch your back with this guy. There's a chance he's gonna break it.
Scott Lang: Hank Pym always said, you never can trust a Stark.
Tony Stark: Who are you?
Scott Lang: Come on, man.
Sam Wilson: How's Rhodes?
Tony Stark: They're flying him to Columbia Medical tomorrow. So . . . fingers cross. What do you need? They feed you yet?
Sam Wilson:  You're the good cop now?
Tony Stark: I'm just the guy who needs to know where Steve went.
Sam Wilson: Well, you better go get a bad cop, because you're gonna have to go Mark Fuhrman on my ass to get information out of me.
Tony Stark: Oh, I just knocked the 'A' out of their 'AV'. We got about 30 seconds before they realize it's not their equipment.
Secretary Ross:  What did you do? Get it back up!
Tony Stark:  Just look. Because that is the fellow who was supposed to interrogate Barnes.  Clearly, I made a mistake. Sam, I was wrong.
Sam Wilson: That's a first.
Tony Stark: Cap is definitely off the reservation but he's about to need all the help he can get. We don't know each other very well. You don't have to…
Sam Wilson: Hey, it's alright.  Look, I'll tell you… but you have to go alone and as a friend.
Tony Stark: Easy.
Secretary Ross: Stark? Did he give you anything on Rogers?
Tony Stark: Nope. Told me to go to hell. I'm going back to the compound instead, but you can call me anytime. I'll put you on hold, I like to watch the line blink.
[Steve brings his Quinjet into land besides Zemo's caterpillar truck on the remote icy mountain top. The jet's wings fold up beside the fuselage.
On board Bucky pulls out rack of guns labeled 'Romanoff'. He takes a light machine gun.
Bucky and Steve stand together, waiting for the exit ramp to descend.]
Steve Rogers: You remember that time we had to ride back from Rockaway Beach in the back of that freezer truck?
Bucky Barnes: Was that the time we used our train money to buy hot dogs?
Steve Rogers: You blew three bucks trying to win that stuffed bear for a redhead.
Bucky Barnes: What was her name again?
Steve Rogers: Dolores. You called her Doll.
Bucky Barnes: She's gotta be a hundred years old right now.
Steve Rogers: So are we, pal.
Steve Rogers: He can't have been here more than a few hours.
Bucky Barnes: Long enough to wake them up.
Steve Rogers: You ready?
Bucky Barnes: Yeah.
Tony Stark: You seem a little defensive.
Steve Rogers: It's been a long day.
Tony Stark: At ease, Soldier. I'm not currently after you.
Steve Rogers: Then why are you here?
Tony Stark: Could be your story's not so crazy. Maybe. Ross has no idea I'm here. I'd like to keep it that way. Otherwise, I gotta arrest myself.
Steve Rogers: Well, that sounds like a lot of paperwork.  It's good to see you, Tony.
Tony Stark: You too, Cap.  Hey, Manchurian Candidate, you're killing me. There's a truce here. You can drop . . .
Tony Stark: I got heat signatures.
Steve Rogers: How many?
Tony Stark: Uh, one.
Helmut Zemo:  If it's any comfort, they died in their sleep.  Did you really think I wanted more of you?
Bucky Barnes: What the hell?
Helmut Zemo: I'm grateful to them, though. They brought you here.  Please, Captain. The Soviets built this chamber to withstand the launch blast of UR-100 rockets.
Tony Stark: I'm betting I could beat that.
Helmut Zemo: Oh, I'm sure you could, Mr. Stark. Given time. But then you'd never know why you came.
Steve Rogers: You killed innocent people in Vienna just to bring us here?
Helmut Zemo: I thought about nothing else for over a year. I studied you. I followed you. But now that you're standing here, I just realized . . . there's a bit of green in the blue of your eyes. How nice to find a flaw.
Steve Rogers: You're Sokovian. Is that what this is about?
Helmut Zemo: Sokovia was a failed state long before you blew it to hell. No. I'm here because I made a promise.
Steve Rogers:  You lost someone?
Helmut Zemo:  I lost everyone. And so will you.  An empire toppled by its enemies can rise again. But one which crumples from within? That's dead . . . forever.
Tony Stark:  I know that road. What is this?
[The video plays. That car that the Winter Soldier forced off the road crashes into a tree. Tony watches intently as the Winter Soldier rides up and gets off his motorbike. Steve watches Tony's increasing unease. The driver lies on the ground beside the car. It's Tony's father, Howard.
Howard Stark: Help my wife. Please. Help.
Howard Stark: Sergeant Barnes?
Maria Stark: Howard!
Maria Stark: Howard!
[In grief Tony closes his eyes for a moment. On screen his father slumps dead. The Winter Soldier puts him in the driver's seat with his face against the steering wheel. Tony stares in horror. Maria's in the passenger seat with blood streaked down her face. The Winter Soldier walks around and grips her throat. Expressionless he strangles Maria. Tony watches the screen stunned. The Winter Soldier walks up and aims a gun at the surveillance camera.
Steve watches Tony anxiously. Tony lunges towards Bucky, Steve stops him.]
Steve Rogers: Tony. Tony.
Tony Stark:  Did you know?
Steve Rogers: I didn't know it was him.
Tony Stark: Don't bullshit me, Rogers! Did you know?
Steve Rogers: Yes.
Steve Rogers:  Get out of here!
Steve Rogers: It wasn't him, Tony. Hydra had control of his mind!
Tony Stark: Move!
Steve Rogers: It wasn't him!
FRIDAY: Left boot jet failing. Flight systems compromised.
Tony Stark: Ah crap.
Steve Rogers: He's not going to stop. Go.
Tony Stark: Come on, come on.
FRIDAY: Targeting system's knackered, boss.
Tony Stark: I'm eyeballing it.  Do you even remember them?
Bucky Barnes: I remember all of them.
Steve Rogers: This isn't gonna change what happened.
Tony Stark: I don't care. He killed my mom.
Zemo's Wife: You should've seen his little face. Just try, okay? I'm going to bed. I love you.
T'Challa:  I almost kill the wrong man.
Helmut Zemo: Hardly an innocent one.
T'Challa: This is all you wanted? To see them rip each other apart.
Helmut Zemo:  My father lived outside the city. I thought we would be safe there. My son was excited. He could see the Iron Man from the car window. I told my wife, "Don't worry. They are fighting in the city. We're miles from harm." When the dust cleared . . . and the screaming stopped. It took me two days until I found their bodies. My father . . . still holding my wife and son in his arms. And the Avengers? They went home. I knew I couldn't kill them. More powerful men than me have tried. But, if I could get them to kill each other . . . I'm sorry about your father. He seemed a good man. With a dutiful son.
T'Challa: Vengeance has consumed you. It's consuming them.  I am done letting it consume me. Justice will come soon enough.
Helmut Zemo:  Tell that to the dead.
T'Challa: The living are not done with you yet.
FRIDAY: You can't beat him hand to hand.
Tony Stark: Analyse his fight pattern.
FRIDAY: Scanning!  Countermeasures ready.
Tony Stark:  Let's kick his ass.
Steve Rogers: He's my friend.
Tony Stark: So was I.  Stay down. Final warning.
Steve Rogers:  I can do this all day.
Tony Stark: That shield doesn't belong to you.  You don't deserve it. My father made that shield!
Everett Ross: Meals at eight and five. Toilet privileges twice a day. Raise your voice, zap. Touch the glass, zap. You step out of line, you deal with me. Please, step out of line. Hmm?  So how does it feel? To spend all that time, all that effort . . . and, to see it fail so spectacularly?
Helmut Zemo:  Did it?
Tony Stark: It's just the first pass.
James Rhodes: Yeah.
Tony Stark: Give me some feedback. Anything you can think of. Shock absorption. Lateral movement. Cup holder?
James Rhodes: You may wanna think about some AC down in . . .
Tony Stark: Let's go. I'll give you a hand.
James Rhodes: No, no, don't. Don't help me. Don't help me.  138. 138 combat missions. That's how many I've flown, Tony. Every one of them could've been my last, but I flew 'em. Because the fight needed to be fought. It's the same with these Accords. I signed because it was the right thing to do. And, yeah, this sucks. This is . . . this is a bad beat. But it hasn't change my mind. I don't think.
Tony Stark: You okay?
James Rhodes: Oh yeah.
FedEx Driver Stan Lee:  Are you Tony "Stank"?
James Rhodes: Yes, this is--this is Tony "Stank". You're in the right place. Thank you for that! I'm never dropping that, by the way. Table for one, Mr. "Stank". Please, by the bathroom.
Steve Rogers:  Tony, I'm glad you're back at the compound. I don't like the idea of you rattling around a mansion by yourself. We all need family. The Avengers are yours, maybe more so than mine. I've been on my own since I was 18. I never really fit in anywhere, even in the army. My faith's in people, I guess. Individuals. And I'm happy to say that, for the most part, they haven't let me down. Which is why I can't let them down either. Locks can be replaced, but maybe they shouldn't. I know I hurt you, Tony. I guess I thought by not telling you about your parents I was sparing you, but I can see now that I was really sparing myself, and I'm sorry. Hopefully one day you can understand. I wish we agreed on the Accords, I really do. I know you're doing what you believe in, and that's all any of us can do. That's all any of us should . . .
FRIDAY: Priority call from Secretary Ross. There's been a breach at the Raft prison.
Tony Stark: Yeah, put him through.
Secretary Ross: Tony, we have a problem.
Tony Stark: Ah, please hold.
Secretary Ross: No. Don't . . .
Steve Rogers:  So, no matter what. I promise you, if you need us, if you need me, I'll be there.
Steve Rogers: You sure about this?
Bucky Barnes: I can't trust my own mind. So, until they figure out how to get this stuff out of my head I think going back under is the best thing . . . for everybody.
Steve Rogers: Thank you for this.
T'Challa: Your friend and my father, they were both victims. If I can help one of them find peace…
Steve Rogers: You know, If they find out he's here . . . they'll come for him.
T'Challa: Let them try.
May Parker: So. Who was it? Who hit you?
Peter Parker: Some guy. So itchy, man. God.
May Parker: What's "some guy's" name?
Peter Parker: Uh, Steve.
May Parker: Steve? From 12-C? With the overbite?
Peter Parker: No, no, no. You don't know him, he's from Brooklyn.  Ouch.
May Parker: Well . . . I hope you got a few good licks in.
Peter Parker: Yeah, I got quite a few in, actually. His friend was huge. Like huge.  That's way better. Thank you.
May Parker: Okay, tough guy.
Peter Parker: Love you, May. Hey, can you shut the door?
Ebony Maw: Hear me, and rejoice. You have had the privilege of being saved by the Great Titan. You may think this is suffering. No... It is salvation. Universal scales tip toward balance because of your sacrifice. Smile... For even in death, you have become Children of Thanos.
Thaos:  I know what it's like to lose. To feel so desperately that you're right... yet to fail, nonetheless.  It's frightening. Turns the legs to jelly. I ask you, to what end? Dread it. Run from it. Destiny arrives all the same. And now, it's here. Or should I say... I AM.
Thor:  You talk too much.
Thanos:  the Tesseract, or your brother's head. I assume you have a preference.
Loki: Oh, I do. Kill away!
Loki:  ALRIGHT, STOP!
Thor: We don't have the Tesseract. It was destroyed on Asgard.
Thor: You really are the worst, brother.
Loki:  I assure you, brother, the Sun will shine on us again.
Thanos: Your optimism is misplaced, Asgardian.
Loki: Well, for one thing: I'm not Asgardian. And for another... We have a Hulk.
Steppenwolf: Let him have his fun.
Munk: Allfathers... let the dark magic flow through me one last... time.
Darkseid: That was a mistake.
Iroque: NO!!! You're going to die for that!
Steppenwolf: Shhhh.  My humble personage... bows before your grandeur. No other being has ever had the might, nay the nobility, to wield not one, but two Lantern Rings. The universe lies within your grasp.
Darkseid: There are two more Stones on Earth. Find them, my children, and bring them to me on Apokolips.
Grail: Father, we will not fail you.
Trinity:  If I might, interject... If you're going to Earth, you might want a guide. I do have a bit of experience in that arena.
Darkseid: If you consider failure experience...
Trinity: I consider experience, experience. Almighty Darkseid. I, Trinity, Warrior of Nok... Elithian... The rightful Soldier of Nok, Tribe of Compassion, do hereby pledge to you, my undying fidelity.
Darkseid: “Undying.” You should choose your words more carefully.
Trinity:  You... will never be... a god.
Darkseid: No resurrections this time.
Iroque: No... Trinity...
Saint Walker: Seriously? You don't have any money?
Shazam: Attachment to the material is detachment from the spiritual.
Saint Walker: I'll tell the guys at the deli. Maybe they'll make you a metaphysical Ham on Rye.
Shazam: Oh, wait, wait, wait, I think I have 200.
Saint Walker: Dollars?
Shazam: Rupees.
Saint Walker: Which is?
Shazam: Uh, buck and a half.
Saint Walker: What do you want?
Shazam: I wouldn't say no to a Tuna Melt.
Shane Thompson: Darkseid is coming. He's coming...
Saint Walker:  ... Who?
Clark Kent: Slow down, slow down. I'm totally not kidding. Lois Lane:  You're totally rambling.
Clark Kent: No, I'm not.
Lois Lane: Lost me.
Clark Kent: Look, you know how you're having a dream, and in the dream you gotta pee?
Lois Lane: Yeah.
Clark Kent: Okay, and then you're like, “Oh my god, there's no bathroom, what am I gonna do?” “Oh! Someone's watching.” “I'm gonna go in my pants.”
Lois Lane: Right. And then you wake up, and in real life you actually have to pee.
Clark Kent: Yes.
Lois Lane: Yeah. Everybody has that.
Clark Kent: Right! That's the point I'm trying to make. Apropos of that, last night, I dreamt, we had a kid. So real. We named him after your eccentric uncle. Uh, what was his name?
Lois Lane:  Right.
Clark Kent: Morgan! Morgan.
Lois Lane: So you woke up, and thought that we were...
Clark Kent: Expecting.
Lois Lane: Yeah.
Clark Kent:  Yes?
Lois Lane: [Shaking her head} No.
Clark Kent: I had a dream about it. It was so real.
Lois Lane: If you wanted to have a kid, you wouldn't have done that.
Clark Kent: I'm glad you brought this up, 'cause it's nothing. It's just a housing unit for nano particles.
Lois Lane: It's not helping your case, OK?
Clark Kent: No, no, it's an attachment, it's not a-
Lois Lane: {Insistently] You don't need that.
Clark Kent: I know. I had the surgery. I'm just trying to protect us. The future, us, and that's it. Just in case there's a monster in the closet, instead of, you know...
Lois Lane: Shirts?
Clark Kent: You know me so well. You finish all my sentences.
Lois Lane: You should have shirts in your closet.
Clark Kent: Yeah. You know what there should be? No more surprises. We're gonna have a nice dinner tonight. Show off this Harry Winston. Right? And we should have no more surprises. Ever. I should promise you.
Lois Lame: Yes.
Clark Kent: I will.
Saint Walker: Clark Kent, I'm Doctor Saint Walker. I need you to come with me. Oh, uh, congratulations on the wedding, by the way.
Clark Kent: I'm sorry, you giving out tickets or something?
Saint Walker: We need your help. Look, it's not overselling to say that the fate of the universe is at stake.
Tony Stark: And who's “we”?
Bruce Banner:  Hey, Tony.
Tony Stark:  Bruce.
Bruce Banner: Pepper.
Pepper Potts: Hi.
Tony Stark: You okay?
Wong:  From the dawn of the universe, there was nothing. Then, boom! The Big Bang sent six elemental crystals, hurdling across the virgin universe. These Infinity Stones each control an essential aspect of existence.
Doctor Strange: Space. Reality. Power. Soul. Mind. And Time.
Tony Stark: Tell me his name again.
Bruce Banner: Thanos. He's a plague, Tony. He invades planets, he takes what he wants, he wipes out half the population. He sent Loki! The attack on New York, that's him!
Tony Stark:  This is him...What's our timeline?
Bruce Banner: No telling. He has the Power and Space Stones, that already makes him the strongest creature in the whole universe! If he gets his hands, on all six Stones, Tony...
Doctor Strange: He can destroy life on a scale hither to undreamt of.
Tony Stark:  Did you seriously just say “hither to undreamt of”?
Doctor Strange: Are you seriously leaning on the Cauldron of the Cosmos?
Tony Stark: Is that what this is...?
Tony Stark:  I'm going to allow that. If Thanos needs all six, why don't we just stick this one down the garbage disposal?
Doctor Strange: No can do.
Wong: We swore an oath to protect the Time Stone. With our lives.
Tony Stark: And I swore off dairy, but then, Ben & Jerry's named a flavor after me, so...
Doctor Strange: Stark Raving Hazelnuts.
Tony Stark: It's not bad.
Doctor Strange: A bit chalky.
Wong: “A Hunka-Hulka Burning Fudge” is our favorite.
Bruce Banner: That's a thing?
Tony Stark: Whatever. Point is: Things change.
Doctor Strange: Our oath to protect the Time Stone cannot change. This Stone may be the best chance we have against Thanos.
Tony Stark: And still conversely, it may also be his best chance against us.
Doctor Strange: Well, if we don't do our jobs.
Tony Stark: What is your job exactly, besides making balloon animals?
Doctor Strange: Protecting your reality, douchebag.
Bruce Banner: Okay, guys, can we quick cable this discussion right now? The fact is that we have the Stone. We know where it is. Vision is out there somewhere with the Mind Stone, and we have to find him now.
Tony Stark:  Yeah, that's the thing.
Bruce Banner: What do you mean?
Tony Stark: Two weeks ago, Vision turned off his transponder. He's offline.
Bruce Banner: What?! Tony, you lost another super bot?!
Tony Stark: I didn't lose him. He's more than that. He's evolving.
Doctor Strange: Who could find Vision, then?
Tony Stark: Shit. Probably Steve Rogers.
Doctor Strange:  Oh, great.
Tony Stark: Maybe. But...
Bruce Banner:  Call him.
Tony Stark: It's not that easy. God, we haven't caught up in a spell, have we?
Bruce Banner: No.
Tony Stark: The Avengers broke up. We're toast.
Bruce Banner: Broke up? Like a band? Like The Beatles?
Tony Stark: Cap and I fell out hard. We're not on speaking terms.
Bruce Banner: Tony, listen to me. Thor's gone. Thanos is coming. It doesn't matter who you're talking to or not.
Tony Stark: Say, Doc, you wouldn't happen to be moving your hair, would you?
Doctor Strange:  ... Not at the moment, no.
Tony Stark: You okay?
Tony Stark: Help him! Wong, Doc.
Bruce Banner: Go! Got it!
Tony Stark:  F.R.I.D.A.Y., what am I looking at?
F.R.I.D.A.Y.: Not sure, I'm working on it.
Tony Stark: Hey! You might wanna put that Time Stone in your back pocket, Doc!
Doctor Strange: Might wanna use it.
Peter Parker:  Ned, hey. I need you to cause a distraction.
Ned Leeds: Holy shit! We're all gonna die! There's a spaceship!
Stan Lee: What's the matter with you kids? You've never seen a spaceship before?
Tony Stark: F.R.I.D.A.Y., evac anyone south of 43rd Street, notify first responders.
F.R.I.D.A.Y.: Will do.
Ebony Maw: Hear me, and rejoice. You are about to die at the hands of the Children of Thanos. Be thankful, that your meaningless lives are now contributing to...
Tony Stark: I'm sorry, Earth is closed today. You better pack it up and get outta here.
Ebony Maw:  Stone keeper... Does this chattering animal speak for you?
Doctor Strange: Certainly not. I speak for myself. But you're trespassing in this city and on this planet.
Tony Stark: It means get lost Squidward!
Ebony Maw: He exhausts me. Bring me the Stone.
Tony Stark: Banner, you want a piece?
Bruce Banner: No, not really, but when do I ever get what I want?
Tony Stark: That's right.
Tony Stark: Been a while. Good to have you, buddy.
Bruce Banner: I just... I need to concentrate here for one second. Come on, come on, man.
Tony Stark: Where's your guy?
Bruce Banner: I don't know. We've sort been havin' a thing.
Tony Stark: There's no time for a thing.
Bruce Banner: I know.
Tony Stark: That's the thing right there. Let's go.
Tony Stark: {Glances at Strange] Dude, you're embarrassing me in front of the wizards.
Bruce Banner: Tony, I'm sorry.  Either I can't or he won't-
Tony Stark: It's okay. Hey, stand down.  Keep an eye on him. Thank you.
Wong: I have him.
Bruce Banner: Damn it.
Bruce Banner: Where'd that come from?
Tony Stark: It's nano-tech. You like it? A little somet-
Doctor Strange: Dr. Banner, if the rest of your green friend won't be joining us...
Tony Stark: Gotta get that stone outta here, now.
Doctor Strange: It stays with me.
Tony Stark: Exactly. Bye.
Bruce Banner: Tony, you okay? How we doing? Good? bad?
Tony Stark: Really, really good. Really good. Do you plan on helping out?
Bruce Banner: I'm trying. He won't come out.
Tony Stark: Hammer.
Bruce Banner: Come on, Hulk. What are you doing to me? Come out! Come out! Come out!
Hulk: No!
Bruce Banner: What do you mean, “no”?
Peter Parker: Hey, man. What's up, Mr. Stark?
Tony Stark: Kid, where'd you come from?
Peter Parker: Field trip to MoMA.
Peter Parker: What is this guy's problem, Mr. Stark?
Tony Stark: He's from space. He came here to steal a necklace from a wizard.
Ebony Maw: Your powers are quaint. You must be popular with children.
Doctor Strange: It's a simple spell but quite unbreakable.
Ebony Maw: Then I'll take it off your corpse.
Doctor Strange: You'll find...removing a dead man's spell... Troublesome.
Ebony Maw: You'll only wish you were dead. [Strange falls unconscious and is Maw moves to grab him. The Cloak of Levitation flies Strange away} No!
Tony Stark:  Kid, that's the wizard. Get on it.
Peter Parker: On it!
Peter Parker: Not cool!
Peter Parker: Mr. Stark? I'm being beamed up.
Tony Stark: Hang on, kid.  Give me a little juice, F.R.I.D.A.Y.  Unlock 17-A.  Pete, you gotta let go. I'm gonna catch you.
Peter Parker: But you said save the wizard!  I can't breathe!
Tony Stark: You're too high up. You're running out of air.
Peter Parker: Yeah! That makes sense.
Peter Parker: Mr. Stark, it smells like a new car in here!
Tony Stark: Happy trails, kid. F.R.I.D.A.Y, send him home.
F.R.I.D.A.Y: Yup.
Peter Parker: Oh, come on!
F.R.I.D.A.Y: Boss, incoming call from Miss Potts.
Pepper Potts: Tony? Oh, my God. Are you all right? What's going on?
Tony Stark: Yeah, I'm fine. I just think we might have to push our 8:30 res.
Pepper Potts: Why?
Tony Stark:  Just 'cause I'll... probably not make it back for awhile.
Pepper Potts: Tell me you're not on that ship.
Tony Stark: Yeah.
Pepper Potts: God, no. Please tell me you're not on that ship.
Tony Stark: Honey, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I don't know what to say.
Pepper Potts: Come back here, Tony. I swear to God...
Tony Stark: Pep...
Pepper Potts: Come back here right now! Come back!
F.R.I.D.A.Y: Boss, we're losing her. I'm going, too...
Peter Parker: Oh my God. I should have stayed on the bus.
Bruce Banner: Where you going?
Wong: The Time Stone's been taken. The Sanctum remains unguarded. What will you do?
Bruce Banner:  I'm gonna make a call.
Peter Quill:  Sing it, Drax!
Rocket:  Why are we doing this again?
Gamora:  It's a distress signal, Rocket. Someone could be dying.
Rocket: I get that, but why are we doing it?
Peter Quill: ‘Cause we're nice. And maybe whoever it is will give us a little cheddar cheese for our help.
Gamora: Which isn't the point.
Peter Quill:  Which isn't the point... I mean... If he doesn't pony up...
Rocket: We'll take his ship.
Peter Quill: B-b-b-bingo!
Mantis:  We are arriving.
Peter Quill: All right, Guardians. Don't forget, this might be dangerous, so let's put on our mean faces.  Groot, put that thing away. Now. I don't wanna tell you again. Groot.
Groot:   I am Groot!
Peter Quill: Whoa!
Rocket: Language!
Gamora: Hey!
Drax: Wow.
Peter Quill: You got some acorns on you, kid.
Rocket: Ever since you got your little sap, you're a total d-hole. Keep it up, and I'm gonna smash that thing to pieces!
Mantis: What happened?
Rocket: Looks like we're not getting paid.
Rocket:  Wipers! Wipers! Get it off.
Peter Quill: How the hell is this dude still alive?
Drax: He is not a dude. You're a dude. This... This is a man. A handsome, muscular man.
Peter Quill: I'm muscular.
Rocket: Who are you kidding, Quill? You're one sandwich away from fat.
Peter Quill: Yeah, right.
Drax: It's true. You have gained a little weight...
Peter Quill: What? Gamora, do you think I'm...
Mantis: He is anxious. Angry. He feels tremendous loss and guilt.
Drax: It's like a pirate had a baby with an angel.
Peter Quill: Wow. This is a real wake-up call for me. Okay. I'm gonna get a Bowflex. I'm gonna commit. I'm gonna get some dumbbells.
Rocket: You know you can't eat dumbbells, right?
Gamora: It's like his muscles are made of Cotati metal fibers.
Peter Quill: Stop massaging his muscles. Wake him up.
Mantis: Wake.
Thor: Who the hell are you guys?
Gamora: The entire time I knew Thanos, he only ever had one goal: To bring balance to the Universe by wiping out half of all life. He used to kill people planet by planet, massacre by massacre...
Drax: Including my own.
Gamora: If he gets all six Infinity Stones, he can do it with the snap of his fingers, like this.
Thor: You seem to know a great deal about Thanos.
Drax: Gamora... is the daughter of Thanos.
Thor: Your father killed my brother.
Peter Quill: Oh, boy. Stepfather. Technically, she hates him as much as you do.
Thor: Families can be tough. Look. Before my father died, he told me I had a half-sister...that he imprisoned in Hel. Then she returned home, and stabbed me in the eye, so... I had to kill her. It's life, isn't it, I guess. Goes round and round and... I feel your pain.
Peter Quill: And I feel your pain, as well. I mean it's not a competition, but I've been through a lot. My father killed my mother, then I had to kill my father. And that was hard. Probably even harder than having to kill a sister. Plus, I, came out of it with both of my eyes-”
Thor: I need a hammer, not a spoon...  How do I open this thing? Is there some sort of a four-digit code maybe... Maybe a birth date or something...
Peter Quill: What are you doing?
Thor: Taking your pod.
Peter Quill: No, you're not!  You'll not, be taking our pod today, sir.
Rocket: Quill. Are you making your voice deeper?
Peter Quill: No.
Drax: You are. You're imitating the god-man. It's weird.
Peter Quill: No I'm not.
Mantis: He just did it again!
Peter Quill: This is my voice!
Thor:  Are you mocking me?
Peter Quill: Are you mocking me?
Thor: Stop it. You did it again.
Peter Quill: He's trying to copy me.
Thor: Would you stop doing that? He's doing it first.
Gamora: Enough! We need to stop Thanos. Which means we need to find out where he's going next.
Thor: Knowhere.
Mantis: He must be going somewhere.
Peter Quill: No. Knowhere? It's a place. We've been there. It sucks. Excuse me, that's our food.
Thor: Not anymore.
Gamora: Thor... Why would he go to Knowhere?
Thor: Because for years, the Reality Stone has been safely stored, there with a man we call the Collector.
Peter Quill: If it's with the Collector, then it's not safe. Only an idiot would give that man a stone.
Thor: Or a genius.
Gamora:  How do you know he's not going for one of the other Stones?
Thor: There's six stones out there. Thanos already has the Power Stone because he stole it last week, when he decimated Xandar. He stole the Space Stone from me when he destroyed my ship and slaughtered half my people. The Time and Mind Stones are safe on Earth. They're with the Avengers.
Peter Quill: The Avengers?
Thor: They're Earth's Mightiest Heroes.
Mantis: Like Kevin Bacon?
Thor: ...He may be on the team. I don't know. Haven't been there in a while. As for the Soul Stone, well, no one's ever seen that. No one even knows where it is. Therefore, Thanos can't get it. Therefore, he's going to Knowhere. Hence, he'll be getting the Reality Stone. You're welcome.
Gamora: Then we have to go to Knowhere now.
Thor: Wrong. Where we have to go, is Nidavellir.
Drax: That's a made up word.
Thor: All words are made up.
Rocket: Nidavellir is real?  Seriously? I mean, that place is a legend. They make the most powerful, horrific weapons to ever torment the Universe. I would very much like to go there, please.
Thor: The rabbit is correct, and clearly the smartest among you.
Rocket: Rabbit?
Thor: Only Eitri the dwarf king can make me the weapon I need.  I assume you're the captain, sir?
Rocket: You're very perceptive.
Thor: You seem like a noble leader. Will you join me on my quest to Nidavellir?
Rocket: Lemme just ask the captain. Wait a second, it's me! Yeah, I'll go.
Thor: Wonderful.
Peter Quill: Except that I'm the captain.
Rocket: Quiet!
Peter Quill: And that's my backpack.
Rocket: Quill, sit down.
Peter Quill:  Look, this is my ship. And I'm not going to... Wait, what kind of weapon are we talking about here?
Thor: The Thanos killing kind.
Peter Quill: Don't you think that we should all have a weapon like that?
Thor: No. You simply lack the strength to wield them. Your bodies will crumble as your minds collapse into the madness.
Rocket: Is it weird that I wanna do it even more now?
Thor: A little bit. Yeah.
Gamora: If we don't go to Knowhere and Thanos retrieves another stone, he'll be too powerful to stop.
Thor: He already is.
Rocket: I got it figured out. We got two ships, and a large assortment of morons. So me and Groot will go with the pirate-angel here, and the morons will go to Knowhere to try and stop Thanos. Cool? Cool.
Thor: So cool.
Peter Quill:  For the record... I know that you're only going with him because it's where Thanos isn't.
Rocket: You know, Quill, you shouldn't talk that way to your captain.  Come on, Groot. Put that game down. You'll rot your brain.
Thor: I bid you farewell and good luck, morons. Bye.
Vision:
Aurora Maximoff: Vis? Is it the stone again?
Vision: It's as if it's speaking to me.
Aurora Maximoff: What does it say?
Vision: I don't... I don't know. But something... Tell me what you feel.
Aurora Maximoff: I just feel you.
Aurora Maximoff: So there's a 10 AM to Glasgow to give us more time together before you went back.
Vision: What if I miss that train?
Aurora Maximoff: There is an 11.
Vision: What if I missed all the trains? What if this time, I didn't go back?
Aurora Maximoff: You gave Stark your word.
Vision: I'd rather give it to you.
Aurora Maximoff: There are people who are expecting me too, you know. We both made promises.
Vision: Not to each other. Aurora... For two years, we've stolen these moments, trying to see if this could work. And... I don't know. You know what, I'm just gonna speak for myself. – I, I... I think...
Aurora Maximoff: It works.
Vision: It works.
Vision: Then stay. Stay with me.  Or not. If I'm overstepping...
Aurora Maximoff: What are they?
Vision: What the stone was warning me about. I have to go.
Aurora Maximoff: No. Vision. If that's true... Then maybe going isn't the best idea.
Vision: Aurora, I...
Aurora Maximoff: Vision!
Vision: The blade. It stopped me from phasing.
Aurora Maximoff: Is that even possible?
Vision: It isn't supposed to be. My systems are failing. I'm beginning to think... we should have stayed in bed.
Aurora Maximoff: Vis!
Corvus Glaive:  Give up the Stone, and she lives.
Aurora Maximoff: Hands off.
Aurora Maximoff: Come on. Come on. Come on, you gotta get up. You gotta get up. Come on. Hey. Hey. We have to go.
Vision: Please. Please leave.
Aurora Maximoff: You asked me to stay... I'm staying.
Vision: Please.
Aurora Maximoff: Get up.
Proxima Midnight:  Get up.
Corvus Glaive: I can't.
Natasha Romanoff: We don't wanna kill you. But we will.
Proxima Midnight: You'll never get the chance again.
Sam Wilson:  Can you stand?
Vision: Thank you, Captain.
Steve Rogers: Let's get you on the jet.
Natasha Romanoff:  I thought we had a deal. Stay close, check in. Don't take any chances.
Aurora Maximoff: I'm sorry. We just wanted time.
Sam Wilson: Where to, Cap?
Steve Rogers: Home.
Gamora's Mother:  Shhh. We'll be safe. We'll be safe.
Ebony Maw: Zehobereans...
Young Gamora:  Mother!
Ebony Maw: Choose a side, or die.
Young Gamora: Mother!
Ebony Maw: One side, for reservation. The other, an honor...
Thanos: What's wrong, little one?
Young Gamora: My mother. Where is my mother?
Thanos:  What's your name?
Young Gamora: Gamora.
Thanos: You're quite the fighter, Gamora. Come. Let me help you.  Look. Pretty, isn't it? Perfectly balanced. As all things should be. Too much to one side, or the other... Here. You try.
Ebony Maw: Now go in peace, and meet your Maker.
Thanos: Concentrate. There! You've got it.
Peter Quill: Gamora. Do you know if these grenades are the “blow off your junk” kind or the gas kind? ‘Cause I was thinking I might hang a couple on my belt right here. But I don't want to-
Gamora: I need to ask a favor.
Peter Quill: Yeah, sure.
Gamora: One way or another, the path that we're on leads to Thanos.
Peter Quill: Which is what the grenades are for.  I'm sorry. What's the favor?
Gamora: If things go wrong... If Thanos gets me... I want you to promise me... you'll kill me.
Peter Quill: : What?
Gamora: I know something he doesn't. If he finds out... The entire Universe could be at risk.
Peter Quill: What do you know?
Gamora: If I tell you, you'd know, too.
Peter Quill: If it's so important, shouldn't I?
Gamora: Only if you wanna die.
Peter Quill: Why does somebody always have to die in this scenario?
Gamora: Just... trust me. And possibly, kill me.
Peter Quill: I mean, I'd like to. I really would...
Gamora: Swear to me. Swear to me on your mother.
Peter Quill:  Okay.
Peter Quill: Dude! How long have you been standing there?
Drax: An hour.
Peter Quill: An hour? Are you serious?
Drax: I've mastered the ability, of standing so incredibly still... That I've become invisible to the eye. Watch.
Peter Quill: You're eating a zark nut
Drax: But my movement... So slow... And it's imperceptible.
Peter Quill: No.
Drax: I'm sure I'm invisible.
Mantis: Hi, Drax.
Drax: Damn it.
DRAX: I'm reading movement. From the third quadrant.
PETER QUILL: Yep. I'm picking that up, too.
QUILL: Let's put it down right here.
THANOS: Everyone in the Galaxy knows you'd sell your own brother if you thought it would add the slightest trinket to your pathetic collection. I know you have the Reality Stone. Giving it to me will spare you a great deal of suffering.
COLLECTOR: I told you. I sold it. Why would I lie?
THANOS: I imagine it's like breathing for you.
COLLECTOR: Like suicide.
THANOS: So you do understand. Not even you would surrender something so precious.
COLLECTOR: I didn't know what it was.
THANOS: Then you're more of a fool than I took you for. Last chance, Tivan. Where's the Stone?
DRAX: Today...
Peter Quill: Drax. Drax.
Drax: ...he pays for the deaths of my wife and daughter.
QUILL: Drax, wait! not yet, not yet, not yet. He doesn't have the Stone yet. We get it, and then we can stop him. We have to get the Stone first. Yeah.
DRAX: No. No. For Ovette. For Camaria.
MANTIS: Sleep.
QUILL: Okay. Gamora, Mantis, you go right. I'm...  The other right!
THANOS: Why? Why you? Daughter...
QUILL: That was quick.
COLLECTOR: Magnificent! Magnificent! Magnificent!
THANOS: Is it sadness I sense in you, daughter? In my heart, I knew you still cared. But one ever knows for sure. Reality is often disappointing. That is, it was. Now... Reality can be whatever I want.
GAMORA: You knew I'd come.
THANOS: I counted on it. There's something we need to discuss, little one.
DRAX: Thanos!
QUILL: Let her go, Grimace!
GAMORA: Peter...
QUILL: I told you to go right.
GAMORA: Now? Really?
QUILL: You let her go!
THANOS: Ah, the boyfriend.
QUILL: I like to think of myself more as a Titan-killing long term booty call. Let her go.
GAMORA: Peter...
QUILL: Or I'm gonna blow that nut-sack of a chin right off your face!
GAMORA: Not him.
GAMORA: You promised! You promised.
THANOS: Oh, daughter. You expect too much from him.  She's asked, hasn't she? Do it.  Do it!
QUILL: I told you to go right.
GAMORA: I love you, more than anything.
QUILL: I love you, too.
THANOS: I like you.
ROSS: Still no word from Vision?
RHODES: Satellites lost him somewhere over Edinburgh.
ROSS: On a stolen quinjet with four of the world's most wanted criminals.
RHODES: You know they're only criminals because you've chosen to call them that, right, sir?
ROSS: My God, Rhodes, your talent for horseshit rivals my own.
RHODES: If it weren't for those Accords, Vision would've been right here.
ROSS: I remember your signature on those papers, Colonel.
RHODES: That's right. And I'm pretty sure I've paid for that.
ROSS: You have second thoughts?
RHODES: Not anymore.
ROGERS: Mr. Secretary.
ROSS: You got some nerve. I'll give you that.
NATASHA: You could use some of that right now.
ROSS: The world's on fire. And you think, all is forgiven?
ROGERS: I'm not looking for forgiveness. And I'm way past asking for permission. Earth just lost her best defender. So we're here to fight. And if you wanna stand in our way... We'll fight you, too.
ROSS : Arrest them.
RHODES: All over it.  That's a court-martial. It's great to see you, Cap.
ROGERS: You too, Rhodey.
RHODES: Well. You guys, really look like crap. Must've been a rough couple of years.
SAM: Yeah, well, the hotels weren't exactly five star.
BRUCE: Uh, I think you look great. Yeah. I'm back.
NATASHA: Hi, Bruce.
BRUCE: Nat.
SAM WILSON: This is awkward.
BRUCE: So we gotta assume they're coming back, right? And they can clearly find us. We need all hands on deck. Where's Clint?
NATASHA: After the whole Accords situation, he and Scott took a deal. It was too tough on their families.
BRUCE: Who's Scott?
ROGERS: Ant-Man.
BRUCE: There's an Ant-Man and a Spider-Man? Okay, look... Thanos has the biggest army in the Universe. And he is not gonna stop until he... He gets...Vision's stone.
Natasha: Well then, we have to protect it.
VISION: No, we have to destroy it. I've been giving a good deal of thought to this entity in my head, about its nature. But also, its composition. I think if it were exposed to a sufficiently powerful energy source, something, very similar to its own signature, perhaps... Its molecular integrity could fail.
AURORA: And you, with it. We're not having this conversation.
VISION: Eliminating the stone is the only way to be certain that Thanos can't get it.
AURORA: That's too high a price.
VISION: Only you, have the power to pay it. Thanos threatens half the Universe. One life cannot stand in the way of defeating him.
ROGERS: But it should. We don't trade lives, Vision.
VISION:  Captain, 70 years ago, you laid down your life to save how many millions of people. Tell me, why is this any different?
BRUCE: Because you might have a choice. Your mind is made up of a complex construct of overlays. Jarvis, Ultron, Tony, me, the Stone. All of them mixed together. All of them learning from one another.
AURORA: You're saying Vision isn't just the stone?
BRUCE: I'm saying that... If we take out the stone, there's still a whole lot of Vision left. Perhaps the best parts.
NATASHA: Can we do that?
BRUCE: Not me. Not here.
RHODEY: You better find someone, and somewhere fast. Ross isn't exactly just gonna let you guys have your old rooms back.
ROGERS:  I know somewhere.
Okoye: You'll have the King's Guard, and the Dora Milaje have been alerted.
T'Challa: And the border tribe?
Okoye: Those that are left.
T'Challa: Send word to the Jabari as well. M'Baku likes a good fight.
Okoye: And what of this one?
T'Challa: This one may be tired of war. but the White Wolf has rested long enough.
BUCKY: Where's the fight?
T'CHALLA: On it's way.
Ebony Maw: In all the time I've served Thanos, I've never failed him. If I were to reach our rendezvous on Titan with the Time Stone still attached to your vaguely irritating person, there would be...judgement. Give me... the stone.
Tony Stark: Wow you're a seriously loyal piece of outerwear, aren't you?
Peter Parker: Yeah, uh, speaking of loyalty...
Tony Stark: What the-
Peter Parker: I know what you're gonna say.
Tony Stark: You should not be here.
Peter Parker: I was gonna go home-
Tony Stark: I don't wanna hear it.
Peter Parker: But it was such a long way down and I just thought about you on the way-
Tony Stark: And now I gotta hear it.
Peter Parker: ...And I kinda stuck to the side of the ship. And this suit is ridiculously intuitive, by the way. So if anything, it's kinda your fault that I'm here.
Tony Stark:  What did you just say?
Peter Parker: I take that back. And now I'm here in space.
Tony Stark: Yeah. Right where I don't want you to be. This isn't Coney Island. This isn't a field trip. It's one-way ticket. You hear me? Don't pretend like you thought this through. You could not have possibly thought this through.
Peter Parker: No. I did think this through.
Tony Stark: You could not have possibly thought this through.
Peter Parker: It's just- You can't be a friendly neighborhood Spider – Man when there's no neighborhood.  Okay. That didn't really make any sense, but you know what I'm trying to say.
Tony Stark: Come on. We got a situation. See him down there? He's in trouble. What's your plan? Go.
Peter Parker: Um. Okay. Okay...uh...did you ever see that really old movie, Aliens?
EBONY MAW: Painful aren't they? They were originally designed for microsurgery. And any one of them...
EBONY MAW: ...could end your friend's life in an instant.
Tony Stark: I gotta tell you, he's not really my friend. Saving his life is more a professional courtesy.
EBONY MAW: You've saved nothing. Your powers are inconsequential compared to mine.
Tony Stark: Yeah, but the kid's seen more movies.
Peter Parker: Yes! Wait what are those!
Peter Parker: Hey, we haven't officially met.  Cool.
Strange: We've gotta turn this ship around.
Tony Stark: Yeah. Now he wants to run. Great plan.
Strange: No, I want to protect the stone.
Tony Stark: And I want you to thank me. Go ahead. I'm listening.
Strange: For what? Nearly blasting me into space?
Tony Stark: Who just saved your magical ass? Me.
Strange: I seriously don't know how you fit your head into that helmet.
Tony Stark: Admit it. You should have ducked out when I told you to. I tried to bench you. You refused.
Strange: Unlike everyone else in your life, I don't work for you.
Tony Stark: And due to that fact, we're now in a flying doughnut billions of miles away from Earth with no backup.
Peter Parker: I'm backup.
Tony Stark: No. You're a stowaway. The adults are talking.
Strange: I'm sorry, I'm confused as to the relationship here. What is he, your ward?
Peter Parker: No. I'm peter, by the way.
Strange: Doctor Strange.
Peter Parker: Oh we're using our made-up names. Um...I'm Spider-Man, then.
Tony Stark: This ship is self-correcting its course. Thing's on autopilot.
Strange: Can we control it? Fly us home?  Stark?
Tony Stark: Yeah.
Strange: Can you get us home?
Tony Stark: Yeah I heard you. I'm thinking...I'm not so sure we should.
Strange: Under no circumstance can we bring the Time Stone to Thanos. I don't think you quite understand what's at stake here.
Tony Stark: No. It's you who doesn't understand. Thanos has been inside my head for six years...Since he sent an army to New York and now he's back! And I don't know what to do. So I'm not so sure if it's a better plan to fight him on out turf or his but you saw what they did, what he can do. At least on his turf, he's not expecting it. So I say we take the fight to him. Doctor. Do you concur?
Strange:  Alright , Stark. We go to him. But you have to understand...if it comes to saving you or the kid or the Time Stone... I will not hesitate to let either of you die. I can't, because the fate of the universe depends on it.
Tony Stark: Good. Nice. Moral compass. We're straight.  Alright, kid. You're an Avenger now.
Thanos: I thought you might be hungry.
Gamora: I always hated that chair.
Thanos: So I've been told. Even so. I'd hoped you'd sit on it one day.
Gamora: I hated this room. This ship. I hated my life.
Thanos: You told me that too. Every day. For almost twenty years.
Gamora: I was a child when you took me.
Thanos: I saved you.
Gamora: No. No. We were happy on my home planet.
Thanos: Going to bed hungry. scrounging for scraps. Your planet was on the brink of collapse. I'm the one who stopped that. Do you know what's happened since then? The children born have known nothing but full bellies and clear skies. It's a paradise.
Gamora: Because you murdered half the planet.
Thanos: A small price to pay for salvation.
Gamora: You're insane.
Thanos: Little one, it's a simple calculus. This universe is finite, it's resources finite. If life is left unchecked, life will cease to exist. It needs correction.
Gamora: You don't know that!
Thanos: I'm the only one who knows that. At least, I'm the only one with the will to act on it. For a time...you had that same will...as you fought by my side. Daughter.
Gamora: I'm not your daughter. Everything I hate about myself you taught me.
Thanos: And in doing so, made you the fiercest woman in the galaxy. That's why I trusted you to find the Soul Stone.
Gamora: I'm sorry I disappointed you.
Thanos: I am disappointed. But not because you didn't find it. But because you did. And you lied.
Gamora: Nebula.
Gamora: Don't do this.
Thanos: Some time ago, your sister snuck aboard this ship to kill me.
Gamora: Please don't do this.
Thanos: And very nearly succeeded. So I brought her here. To talk.
Gamora: Stop. Stop it. I swear to you on my life. I never found the Soul Stone.
Memory Nebula: You know what he's about to do. He's finally ready, and he's going for the stones. All of them.
Memory Gamora: He can never get them all.
Memory Nebula: He will!
Memory Gamora: He can't, Nebula. Because I found the map to the Soul stone and I burnt it to ash. I burnt it.
Thanos:  You're strong. Me. You're generous. Me. But I never taught you to lie. That's why you're so bad at it. Where is the Soul Stone?
Gamora: Vormir!
Gamora: The Soul Stone is on Vormir.
Thanos: Show me.
Groot:  I am Groot.
Rocket: Tinkle in the cup. We're not looking. What's there to see? What's a twig? Everybody's seen a twig.
Groot:  I am Groot.
Thor:  Tree, pour what's in the cup out in space, and go in the cup again.
Rocket: You speak Groot?
Thor: Yes, they taught it on Asgard. It was an elective.
Groot:  I am Groot.
Thor: You'll know when we're there. Nidavellir's forge harnesses the power of a blazing neutron star.  It's the birth place of my hammer. It's truly awesome.
Rocket: Okay, time to be the captain.  So, dead brother, huh? Yeah, that can be annoying.
Thor: Well, he's been dead before, but this time I think it really might be true.
Rocket: And you said your sister and your dad?
Thor: Both dead.
Rocket: Still got a mom, though?
Thor: Killed by a dark elf.
Rocket: A best friend?
Thor: Stabbed through the heart.
Rocket: Are you sure you're up to this particular murder mission?
Thor:  Absolutely. Rage, vengeance, anger, loss, regret...They're all tremendous motivators. They really clear the mind. So I'm good to go.
Rocket: Yeah, but this Thanos we're talking about...He's the toughest there is.
Thor: Well, he's never fought me.
Rocket: Yeah, he has.
Thor: He's never fought me twice. And I'm getting a new hammer, don't forget.
Rocket: Better be some hammer.
Thor: You know, I'm 1,500 years old. I've killed twice as many enemies as that, and every one would have rather killed me, but none succeeded. I'm only alive because fate wants me alive. Thanos is the latest in a long line of *morons* and he will be the latest to feel my vengeance.
Rocket: And what if you're wrong?
Thor: If I'm wrong then what more could I lose?
Rocket: I could lose a lot. Me personally. I could lose a lot.  Okay. If fate does want you to kill that crapsack... You're gonna need more than one stupid eyeball.
Thor: What's this?
Rocket: What's it look like? Some jerk lost a bet with me on on Contraxia.
Thor: He gave you his eye?
Rocket: He gave me 100 credits. I snuck in later that night and stole his eye.
Thor: Thank you, sweet rabbit.
Rocket: Hmm. Huh? Oh. I would've washed that. The only way I could sneak it off Contraxia was up my...Hey, we're here!
Thor:  I don't think this thing works. Everything seems dark.
Rocket: It ain't the eye.
Thor: Something's wrong. The star's gone out. And the rings are frozen.
Rocket: I hope these dwarves are better at forging than they are cleaning...Maybe they realized they live in a junk pile in the middle of space...
Thor: This forge hasn't gone dark in centuries...
Rocket:  You said Thanos had a gauntlet, right?
Thor: Yes. Why?
Rocket: Look anything like that?
Groot: I am Groot.
Rocket: Go back to the pod.
Thor: Eitri, wait! Stop! Stop.
Eitri: Thor?
Thor: What happened here?
Eitri: You were supposed to protect us. Asgard was supposed to protect us!
Thor: Asgard is destroyed. Eitri, the glove. What did you do?
Eitri:  300 dwarves lived on this ring. I thought if I did what he asked, they'd be safe. I made what he wanted. A device capable of harnessing the power of the stones. Then he killed everyone anyway. All except me. “Your life is yours.” he said “But your hands are mine alone.”
Thor: Eitri, this isn't about your hands. Every weapon you've designed, every axe, hammer sword...It's all inside your head. Now I know all hope feels lost. Trust me, I know. But together, you and I, we can kill Thanos.
Nebula: Mantis, listen very carefully. I need you to meet me on Titan.
Peter Parker:  Hey, what's going on?
Tony Stark: I think we're here. I don't think this rig has a self-park function.  Get your hand into this steering gimbal. Close those around it. You understand?
Peter Parker: Yep, got it.
Tony Stark: This was meant for one big guy, so we gotta to move at the same time.
Peter Parker: Okay. Okay. Ready.
Tony Stark: We might wanna turn.
Peter Parker: Turn! Turn! Turn!
Tony Stark:  You alright?
Tony Stark: That was close. I owe you one.
Peter Parker: Let me just say, if aliens wind up implanting eggs in my chest or something...And I end up eating you, I'm sorry.
Tony Stark:  I don't wanna hear another single pop culture out of you for the rest of the trip. You understand?
Peter Parker: I'm trying to say that something is coming.
Drax:  Thanos!
Peter Parker:  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Please don't put your eggs in me!
Star-Lord: Stay down, clown.
Drax:  Die, blanket of death!
Star-Lord: Everybody stay where you are. Chill F out.  I'm gonna ask you this one time. Where's Gamora?
Tony Stark: Yeah, I'll do you one better. Who's Gamora?
Drax: I'll do you one better! Why is Gamora?
Star-Lord: Tell me where the girl is, or I swear to you, I'm gonna French fry this little freak.
Tony Stark: Let's do it! You shoot my guy, I blast him. Let's go!
Drax: Do it, Quill! I can take it.
Mantis: No he can't take it!
Strange: She's right. You can't.
Star-Lord: Oh yeah? You don't wanna tell me where she is? That's fine. I'll kill all three of you and beat it out of Thanos myself.  Starting with you.
Strange: Wait, what, Thanos? All right, let me ask you this one time. What master do you serve?
Star-Lord: What master do I serve? What am I supposed to say? “Jesus”?
Tony Stark: You're from Earth?
Star-Lord: I'm not from Earth. I'm from Missouri.
Tony Stark: Yeah, that's on Earth dip-shit. What are you hassling us for?
Peter Parker: So, you're not with Thanos?
Star-Lord: With Thanos?  No, I'm here to kill Thanos. He took my girl- Wait, who are you?
Peter Parker: We're the Avengers, man.
Star-Lord: Oh.
Mantis: You're the ones Thor told us about.
Tony Stark: You know Thor?
Star-Lord: Yeah. Tall guy, not the good-looking, needed saving.
Tony Stark: Where is he now?
Rocket: This is plan? We're gonna hit him with a brick?
Eitri: It's a mold. A king's weapon. Meant to be the greatest in Asgard. In theory, it could even summon the Bifrost.
Thor: Did it have a name?
Eitri: Stormbreaker.
Rocket: That's a bit much.
Thor: So how do we make it?
Eitri: You'll have to restart the forge. Awaken the heart of a dying star.
Thor: Rabbit, fire up the pod.
Quill: The *heck* happened to this planet? It's eight degrees off its axis. Gravitational pull is all over the place.
Tony Stark: Yeah, we got one advantage. He's coming to us. We'll use it. All right, I have a plan. Or at least the beginnings of one. It's pretty simple. We draw him in, pin him down, get what we need. Definitely don't wanna dance with this guy. We just need the gauntlet.
Tony Stark: Are you yawning? In the middle of this, while I'm breaking it down? Huh? Did you hear what I said?
Drax: I stopped listening after you said, “We need a plan.”
Tony Stark:  Okay, Mr. Clean is on his own page.
Quill: See, “not winging it” isn't really what they do.
Peter Parker: Uh, what exactly do they do?
Mantis: Kick names, take ass.
Drax:  Yeah, that's right
Tony Stark:  Alright, just get over her, please. Mr. Lord can you get your folks to circle up?
Quill: “Mr. Lord.” Star-Lord is fine.
Tony Stark: We gotta coalesce. ‘Cause if all we come at him with is a plucky attitude..”
Quill: Dude, don't call us plucky. We don't know what is means. Alright, we're optimistic, yes. I like your plan. Except it sucks, so let me do the plans, and that way it might be really good.
Drax: Tell him about the dance-off to save the universe.
Tony Stark: What dance-off?
Quill: It's nothing.
Peter Parker: Like in Footloose, the movie?
Quill:  Exactly like Footloose. Is it still the greatest movie in history?
Peter Parker: It never was.
Tony Stark: Don't encourage this, alright?
Peter Parker: Okay.
Tony Stark: We're getting no help from Flash Gordon here.
Quill: Flash Gordon? By the way, that's a compliment. Don't forget, I'm half human.  So that 50% of me that's stupid... That's 100% you.
Tony Stark: Your math is blowing my mind.
Mantis: Excuse me, but...Does your friend often do that?
Tony Stark: Strange, we alright?
Tony Stark: You're back. You're alright. Hi.
Peter Parker: Hey, what was that?
Strange:  I went forward in time to view alternate futures. To see all the possible outcomes of the coming conflict.
Quill: How did you see?
Strange: 14,000,605.
Tony Stark: How many did we win?
Strange: One.
Thanos: The stone had better be up there...For your sister's sake.
Stonekeeper: Welcome, Thanos, son of Eros. Gamora, daughter of Thanos.
Thanos: You know us?
Stonekeeper: It is my curse to know all who journey here.
Thanos: Where's the Soul Stone?
Stonekeeper: You should know...It extracts a terrible price.
Thanos: I am prepared.
Stonekeeper: We all think that at first.  We are all wrong.
Thanos: How is it you know this place so well?
Red Skull: A lifetime ago, I, too, sought the stones. I even held one in my hand. But it cast me out, banished me here. Guiding others to a treasure I cannot possess.
Red Skull: What you seek lies before you. As does what you fear.
Thanos: What's this?
Red Skull: The price. Soul hold a special place among the Infinity Stones. You might say it has a certain wisdom.
Thanos: Tell me what it needs.
Red Skull: To ensure that whoever possesses it... Understands its power... The stone demands a sacrifice.
Thanos: Of what?
Red Skull: In order to take the stone you must lose that which you love. A soul...For a soul.
Gamora: All my life, I dreamed of a day...A moment when you would get what you deserved. And I was always so disappointed. But now...You kill and torture...And you call it mercy. The universe has judged you. You asked it for a prize, and it told you no. You failed. And do you wanna know why? Because you love nothing. No one.
Thanos:  No.
Gamora: Really? Tears?
Red Skull: They're not for him.
Gamora: No. This isn't love.
Thanos: I ignored my destiny once. I cannot do that again. Even for you. I'm sorry, little one.
Gamora: No!
Sam: Drop to 2600, heading 0-3-0. I hope you're right about this, Cap. Or we're gonna land a lot faster than you want to.
Okoye:  When you said we were going to open Wakanda to the rest of the world...This is not what I imagined.
T'Challa: And what did you imagine?
Okoye: The Olympics. Maybe even a Starbucks.
Bruce Banner:  Should we bow?
Rhodes: Yeah, he's a king.
Steve Rodgers: Seems like I'm always thanking you for something.
Rhodes: What are you doing?
T'Challa: Uh, we don't do that here.  So how big of an assault can we expect?
Bruce Banner: Uh, sir, I think you can expect quite a big assault.
Steve Rodgers: How we looking?
T'Challa: You will have my King's Guard, the Border Tribe, the Dora Milaje, and...
Bucky:  A semi-stable, 100-year-old man.
Steve: How you been, Buck?
Bucky: Uh, not bad, for the end of the world.
Shuri: Whoa. The structure is polymorphic.
Bruce: Right, we had to attach each neuron non-sequentially.
Shuri: Why didn't you just reprogram the synapses to work collectively?
Bruce:  Because, we didn't think of it.
Shuri:  I'm sure you did your best.
Aurora: Can you do it?
Shuri: Yes, but there are more than two trillion neurons here. One misalignment could cause a cascade of circuit failures.  It will take time, brother.
Steve: How long?
Shuri: As long as you can give me.
Okoye:  Something's entered the atmosphere.
Sam:  Hey, Cap, we got a situation here.
Bucky: God, I love this place.
Sam: Yeah, don't start celebrating yet, guys. We got more incoming outside the dome.
Vision:  It's too late. We need to destroy the stone now.
Natasha:  Vision, get your *rear* back on the table.
T'Challa: We will hold them off.
Steve:  Aurora, as soon as the stone's out of his head...you blow it to hell.
Aurora: I will.
T'Challa: Evacuate the city. Engage all defense procedures.  And get this man a shield.
Rocket: I don't think you get the scientifics here. These rings are gigantic.You wanna get them moving...You're gonna need something a lot bigger to yank 'em loose.
Thor: Leave that to me.
Rocket: Leave that to you? Buddy, you're in space. All you got is a rope and a-
Thor: More power, rabbit!
Eitri: Well done, boy.
Thor: That's Nidavellir.
Eitri: *Dang* it.
Rocket: “*Dang* it.”? What's “*dang* it?
Eitri: The mechanism is crippled.
Thor: What?
Eitri: With the iris closed I can't heat the metal.
Thor: How long will it take to heat?
Eitri: A few minutes, maybe more. Why?
Thor: I'm gonna hold it open.
Eitri: That's suicide.
Thor: So is facing Thanos without that axe.
Natasha: How we looking, Bruce?
Bruce:  Yeah, I think I'm getting the hang of it. Wow! It's like being the Hulk without actually-  I'm okay. I'm okay.
Sam: We got two heat signatures breaking through the tree line.
T'Challa: Thank you for standing with us.
M'Baku:  Of course, brother.
Natasha: Where's your other friend?
Proxima: You will pay for his life with yours. Thanos will have that stone.
Steve: That's not gonna happen.
T'Challa: You are in Wakanda now. Thanos will have nothing but dust and blood.
Proxima: We...Have blood to spare.
Bucky: Did they surrender?
Steve: Not exactly.
Bucky: What the hell?
Natasha: Looks like we pissed her off.
Okoye:  They're killing themselves.
Sam:  You seen the teeth on those things?
Rhodes: Alright, back up, Sam. You're gonna get your wings singed.
Sam: Cap, if these things circle the perimeter and get in behind us...There's nothing between them and Vision.
Steve: Them we better keep 'em in front of us.
Okoye:  How do we do that?
T'Challa: We open the barrier.  On my signal, open North-West Section Seventeen.
Wakandan Officer: Requesting confirmation, My King. You said open the barrier?
T'Challa: On my signal.
M'Baku:  This will be the end of Wakanda.
Okoye: Then it will be the noblest ending in history.
T'Challa: Wakanda Forever!  Now!
T'Challa: How much longer, Shuri?
Shuri: We've barely begun, brother.
T'Challa: You might want to pick up the pace.
Thor: Allfathers, give me strength.
Eitri: You understand, boy? You're about to take the full force of a star. It'll kill you.
Thor: Only if I die.
Eitri: Yes. That's what killing you means.
Eitri: Hold it! Hold it, Thor!
Rocket:  Thor! Say something. Come on. Thor, you okay?  I think he's dying.
Eitri: He needs the axe! Where's the handle? Tree, help me find the handle!
Bruce:  Hah! Hah! Hah! You guys are so screwed now!
Thor: BRING ME THANOS!!!
Strange: Oh, you're much more of a Thanos.
Thanos: I take it the Maw is dead. This day extracts a heavy toll. Still, he accomplished his mission.
Strange: You may regret that. He brought you face-to-face with the Master of the Mystic Arts.
Thanos: And where do you think he brought you? (Star-Lord is near by behind wreckage with his weapon ready, and Spiderman is above the structure where Strange sits.
Strange: Let me guess. Your home?
Thanos:  It was. And it was beautiful.  Titan was like most planets. Too many mouths, and not enough to go around. And when we faced extinction, I offered a solution.
Strange: Genocide.
Thanos: But at random, dispassionate, fair to rich and poor alike. They called me a madman. And what I predicted came to pass.
Strange: Congratulations. You're a prophet.
Thanos: I'm a survivor.
Strange: Who wants to murder trillions.
Thanos: With all six stones, I could simply snap my fingers, and they would all cease to exist. I call that...Mercy.
Strange: And then what?
Thanos: I finally rest...And watch the sun rise on a grateful universe. The hardest choices require the strongest wills.
Strange: I think you'll find our will  equal to yours.
Thanos: Ours?
Tony Stark:  Piece of cake, Quill.
Quill:  Yeah, if your goal was to *tick* him off.
Star-Lord: Boom!
Strange:  Do not let him close his fist.
Spider-Man: Magic.  More magic.
Spider-Man: Magic with a kick!
Spider-Man: Magic with a-
Thanos: Insect!
Thanos: Well, well.
Nebula: You should have killed me.
Thanos: It would've been a waste of parts!
Nebula:  Where's Gamora?!
Tony Stark:  Is he under? Don't let up.
Mantis:  Be quick... He is very strong!
Tony Stark: Parker, help! Get over here.  She can't hold him much longer. Let's go. We gotta open his fingers to get it off!
Star-Lord:  I thought you'd be harder to catch. For the record, this was my plan. Not so strong now, huh? Where's Gamora?
Thanos: ... My... Gamora...?
Star-Lord: Oh, bull–shit. Where is she?
Mantis:  He is in anguish!
Star-Lord: Good.
Mantis:  He... he... he mourns!
Drax: What does this monster have to mourn?!
Nebula:  Gamora.
Star-Lord: ... What?
Nebula: He took her to Vormir. He came back with the Soul Stone...but she didn't.
Tony Stark: Okay, Quill, you gotta cool it right now, understand?
Tony Stark: Don't, don't, don't engage, we've almost got this off!
Star-Lord: Tell me she's lying.  ASSHOLE!!! Tell me you didn't do it!!!
Thanos: I... had... to.
Star-Lord:  No, you didn't... No, you didn't...  NO, YOU DIDN'T!!!
Drax: Quill!
Tony Stark:  Hey, stop! Hey, stop! Stop! Hey, stop! Stop!
Spider-Man: It's coming! It's coming! I got it! I got it...!!
Spider-Man:  Oh, God!
Stonekeeper: Welcome, Thanos, son of Eros, Gamora, daughter of Thanos.
Thanos: You know us?
Stonekeeper: It is my curse to know all who journey here.
Thanos: Where is the Soul Stone?
Stonekeeper: You should know: it extracts a terrible price.
Thanos: I am prepared.
Stonekeeper: We all think that at first.  We are all wrong.
Thanos: How is it you know this place so well?
Red Skull: A lifetime ago, I too sought the stones. I even held one in my hand. But it cast me out, banished me here, guiding others to a treasure I cannot possess.
Gamora: I was a child when you took me.
Thanos: I saved you.
Gamora: No, no, we were happy on my home planet.
Thanos: Going to bed hungry, scrounging for scraps? Your planet was on the brink of collapse. I was the one who stopped that. You know what's happened since then? The children born have known nothing but full bellies and clear skies. It's a paradise.
Gamora: Because you murdered half the planet!
Thanos: A small price to pay for salvation.
Gamora: You're INSANE.
Thanos: Little one, it's a simple calculus. This universe is finite, its resources ... finite. If life is left unchecked, life will cease to exist. It needs correcting.
Gamora: YOU DON'T KNOW THAT!
Thanos: I'm the only one who knows that. At least, I'm the only who the will to act on it.
Rocket: You speak Groot?!
Thor: Yes, they taught it on Asgard. It was an elective.
Groot: I am Groot?
Thor: You'll know when we're close. Nidavellir's forge harnesses the blazing power of a Neutron Star. It's the birthplace of my hammer; it's truly awesome.
Rocket:  Okay, time to be the Captain.  So, dead brother, huh? That can be annoying.
Thor: Well, he's been dead before. But this time... I think it really might be true.
Rocket: And you said that your sister and your dad...
Thor: Both dead.
Rocket: But, still got a mom, though?
Thor: Killed by a Dark Elf.
Rocket: Best friend?
Thor: Stabbed through the heart.
Rocket: You sure you're up for this particular murder mission?
Thor: Absolutely. The rage, vengeance, anger, loss, regret, they're all tremendous motivators. They truly clear the mind... so, I'm good to go.
Rocket: Yeah, but this is Thanos we're talking about, he's the toughest there is.
Thor: Well, he's never fought me.
Rocket: ... Yeah, he has!
Thor: Well, he's never fought me twice. And I'll have a new hammer, don't forget.
Rocket: Well, it'd better be some hammer.
Thor: You know, I'm one thousand and five hundred years old. I've killed twice as many enemies as that, and every one of them would have rather killed me, but none succeeded. I'm only alive because Fate wants me alive. Thanos is just the latest in a long line of bastards, and he'll be the latest to feel my vengeance. Fate wills it so.
Rocket: And what if you're wrong?
Thor: Well, if I'm wrong, then... what more could I lose?
Gamora: All my life I dreamed of a day, a moment, when you got what you deserved. And I was always so disappointed. But now, you kill and torture and you call it mercy. The universe has judged you. You asked it for a prize and it told you no. You failed. And do you wanna know why? Because you love nothing. No one.
Thanos:  No.
Gamora: Really? Tears?
Red Skull: They are not for him.
Gamora: No. This isn't love.
Thanos: I ignored my destiny once. I cannot do that again. Even for you.
Thanos:  I'm sorry, little one.
Gamora:  NO!
Banner: Who's Scott?
Steve Rogers: Ant-Man.
Banner: There's an Ant-Man and a Spider-Man?!
Stark:  We gotta work together. Because if all we come out with is a plucky attitude...
Quill: Dude, don't call us plucky. We don't know what it means. We're more optimistic, yes. I like your plan. Except...it sucks. So, let me do the plan and that way...it might be really good.
Drax: Tell him about the dance-off to save the universe.
Stark: What dance-off?
Quill: It's not a thing.
Parker: Like in Footloose? The movie?
Quill: Exactly like Footloose. Is it still the greatest movie in history?
Parker: It never was.
Stark: Don't encourage this alright we're not getting any help from Flash Gordon.
Quill: Flash Gordon? That's a compliment. Don't forget, I'm half human. So that 50% of me that's stupid, that's 100% you.
Strange: Oh, yeah. You're much more of a “Thanos”.
Thanos: I take it that Maw is dead? This day extracts a heavy toll. Still, he accomplished his mission.
Strange: You may regret that. He brought you face-to-face with the Master of the Mystic Arts.
Thanos: Where do you think he brought you?
Strange: Let me guess. Your home.
Thanos: It was.  And it was beautiful. Titan was like most planets; too many mouths, not enough to go around. And when we faced extinction, I offered a solution.

Strange: Then what?
Thanos: I finally rest and watch the Sun rise on a grateful universe. The hardest choices require the strongest wills.
Strange:  I think you'll find our wills equal to yours.
Thanos: Ours?
Stark: Piece of cake, Quill.
Quill: Yeah, if your goal is to piss him off!
Tony Stark: So this is it. It's all been leading to this.
Thor: Ready?
Steve Rogers: Let's go.
Gamora: He won't stop. Until he destroys half the universe. Everything you know... Everything you love... It will all be gone.
Peter Quill: Let's talk about this plan of yours. I think it's good, except it sucks. So let me do the plan and that way it might be really good. Tony Stark: Wow.
Thanos: The end is near. When I'm done, half of humanity will still exist. Perfectly balanced, as all things should be.
Thor: New haircut? I notice you've copied my beard. Oh, by the way, this is a friend of mine. A tree. Groot: I am Groot. Steve Rogers: I am Steve Rogers.
Black Panther: Thank you for standing with us, M'Baku.
M'Baku: Of course, brother.
Black Panther: How much longer, Shuri?
Bruce Banner:  Hulk. Hulk, I know you like making your entrance at the last second, well, this is it, man. This is the last, last second. Hulk! Hulk! Hulk!  Oh, screw you, you big green asshole! I'll do it myself!
Thor: I told you. You'd die for that!
Thanos: You should've... You... You should've gone for the head!!
Thor: NO!
Thanos: Daughter?
Gamora: Did you do it?
Thanos: Yes.
Gamora:  What did it cost?
Thanos:  ... Everything.
Thor: What did you do?  WHAT DID YOU DO?!
Captain America: Where'd he go? Thor... where'd he go?
Bucky Barnes:  Steve?
T'Challa:  Up, General. Up! This is no place to die.
Okoye: Hezvo...?!
Groot:  I am Groot...
Rocket:  No... No. No. No. No! Groot... no.
War Machine:  Sam? Sam!? Where you at?!
Mantis: Something... is... happening.
Drax:  Quill...?
Tony Stark: Steady, Quill.
Quill: Aw, man.
Strange:  Tony, there was no other way.
Parker:  Mister Stark? I don't feel so good...
Tony Stark:  You're all right.
Parker:  I don't know what's – I don't know what's happening. I don't –  Save me, save me! I don't wanna go, I don't wanna go, Sir, please. Please, I don't wanna go. I don't wanna go... I'm sorry.
Nebula:  He did it.
War Machine: What is this? What the hell is happening?
Captain America: ... Oh, God.
Nick Fury: Still no word from Stark?
Maria Hill: No, not yet. We're watching every satellite in both hemispheres, there's still nothing.
Fury: What is it?
Hill: Multiple bogeys over Wakanda.
Fury: Same energy signatures as New York?
Hill: Ten times bigger.
Fury: Call Klein. We'll meet him at –
Hill: NICK!
Fury: They okay?
Hill: There's no one here.
Fury: Call control. Code Red!
Hill:  Nick...?
Fury: Hill?
Fury: Oh, no. Motherf –
MARIA HILL: Hello?, yes. When? Gather as many as you can.
AGENT : Yes ma’am.
MARIA HILL: Okay, now I want a team of the best there are.
AGENT : Team? What kind of team?
MARIA HILL: I need a team, a team like the Avengers.
AGENT : You sure?
MARIA HILL: Never more.

CLINT BARTON: How about now?
CLINT BARTON: Alright. Ready your fingers.
COOPER BARTON: Nice.
LAURA BARTON: Nice throw, kiddo.
COOPER BARTON: You go.
LAURA BARTON: Hey, you guys want mayo or mustard, or both?
LILA BARTON: Who wants mayo on a hotdog?
CLINT BARTON: Probably your brothers.
CLINT BARTON: Uh, two mustard, please! Thanks, mama.
LAURA BARTON: Mayo or mustard?
NATHANIEL BARTON: How about ketchup?
LAURA BARTON: Ketchup?  I can do ketchup.
CLINT BARTON: Mind your elbow.  Hahaha! Good job, Hawkeye. Go get your arrow.
LAURA BARTON: Hey guys! Enough practice, soup's on!
CLINT BARTON: Alright, we're coming; we're hungry.  Lila, let's go.  Lila?  Honey?  Hey, babe! Babe? Babe? Boys? Boys? Laura?
NEBULA: Wrra!
Tony Stark: You don't need to do that. Because uh... you're just holding position.  Oh yeah, that was close.  That's a goal. We're now one apiece.
NEBULA: I would like to try again.
Tony Stark: We're tied up. Feel the tension? It's fun.
Tony Stark: That was terrible. Now you have a chance to win.
Tony Stark: And... you've won. Congratulations.
Tony Stark: Fair game. Good sport.  Have fun?
NEBULA: It was fun.
Tony Stark: This thing on?  Hey, Miss Potts... Pep. If you find this recording, don't post it on social media. It's gonna be a real tear-jerker. I don't know if you're ever going to see these. I don't even know if you're... if you're still... Oh god, I hope so. Today is day 21, uh 22.  You know, if it wasn't for the existential terror of staring into a void of space, I'd say I'm feeling better today. The infection's run its course, Thanks to the blue meanie back there.  You'd love her. Very practical. Only a tiny bit sadistic. Some fuel cells were cracked during battle, but we figured out a way to reverse the ion charge to buy ourselves about 48 hours of time.  But it's now dead in the water. We're 1000 light years from the nearest 7-11. Oxygen will run out tomorrow. And that'll be it. And Pep, I ... I know I said no more surprises, but I was really hoping to pull off one last one. But it looks like... well you know what it looks like. Don't feel bad about this. I mean, if you grovel for a couple of weeks, and then move on with enormous guilt. I should probably lie down. Please know that... when I drift off, I will think about you. Because it's always you.
Tony Stark: Couldn't stop him.
STEVE ROGERS: Neither could I.
Tony Stark: I lost the kid.
STEVE ROGERS: Tony, we lost.
Tony Stark: Is, uh...?
PEPPER POTTS: Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Tony Stark: It's okay.
JAMES RHODES: It's been 23 days since Thanos came to Earth.
NATASHA ROMANOFF: World governments are in pieces. The parts that are still working are trying to take a census. And it looks like he did... he did exactly what he said he was gonna do. Thanos wiped out fifty percent, of all living creatures.
Tony Stark: Where is he now? Where?
STEVE ROGERS: We don't know. He just opened a portal and walked through.
Tony Stark: What's wrong with him?
ROCKET: Oh, he's pissed. He thinks he failed. Which of course he did, but you know there's a lot of that's going around, ain't there?
Tony Stark: Honestly, until this exact second, I literaly thought you were a Build-A-Bear.
ROCKET: Maybe I am.
STEVE ROGERS: We've been hunting Thanos for three weeks now. Deep Space scans, and satellites, and we got nothing. Tony, you fought him.
Tony Stark: Who told you that?  I didn't fight him. No, he wiped my face with a planet while the Bleecker Street Magician gave away the store. That's what happened. There was no fight.
STEVE ROGERS: Okay.
Tony Stark: He's unbeatable.
STEVE ROGERS: Did he give you any clues, any coordinates, anything?
Tony Stark: Pfft! I saw this coming a few years back. I had a vision. I didn't wanna believe it. Thought I was dreaming.
STEVE ROGERS: Tony, I'm gonna need you to focus.
Tony Stark:  And I needed you. As in past tense. That trumps what you need. It's too late buddy. Sorry. You know what I need?  I need to shave. And I believe I remember telling all youse -
RHODEY: Tony, Tony, Tony!
Tony Stark: Alive and otherwise what we needed was a suit of armor around the world! Remember that? Whether it impacted our precious freedoms or not- that's what we needed!
STEVE ROGERS: Well, that didn't work out, did it?
Tony Stark: I said, "we'd lose". You said, "We'll do that together too." And guess what, Cap? We lost. And you weren't there. But that's what we do, right? Our best work after the fact? We're the Avengers, we're the Avengers. Not the Prevengers.
RHODEY: Okay.
Tony Stark: Right?
RHODEY: You made your point. Just sit down.
Tony Stark: Okay...
RHODEY: Okay?
Tony Stark: Nah, nah. Here's my point. You know what?
RHODEY: Tony, you're sick.
Tony Stark:  She's great, by the way.
RHODEY: Sit down. Sit.
Tony Stark: We need you. You're new blood. Bunch of tired old mules!  I got nothing for you, Cap! I got no coordinates, no clues, no strategies, no options. Zero. Zip. Nada. No trust. Liar.
Tony Stark: Here, take this. You find him, and you put that on. You hide.
STEVE ROGERS: Tony!
Tony Stark: I'm fine. I...
RHODEY: Bruce gave him a sedative. He's gonna probably be out for the rest of the day.
CAROL DANVERS: You guys take care of him. And I'll bring him a Xorrian Elixir when I come back.
NATASHA ROMANOFF: Where are you going?
CAROL DANVERS: To kill Thanos.
NATASHA ROMANOFF: Hey, you know, we usually work as a team here, and between you and I, morale's a little fragile.
STEVE ROGERS: We realize up there is more your territory, but this is our fight too.
RHODEY: You even know where he is?
CAROL DANVERS: I know people who might.
NEBULA:  Don't bother. I can tell you where Thanos is. Thanos spent a long time trying to perfect me. And when he worked, he talked about his great plan. Even disassembled, I wanted to please him. I'd ask "where would we go once his plan was complete?". His answer was always the same: "To the Garden."
RHODEY: That's cute, Thanos has a retirement plan.
STEVE ROGERS: So where is he?
ROCKET: When Thanos snapped his fingers, Earth became ground zero for a power surge of ridiculously cosmic proportions. No one's ever seen anything like it... Until two days ago.  On this planet.
NEBULA: Thanos is there.
NATASHA ROMANOFF: He used the stones again.
BRUCE BANNER: Hey, hey, hey. We'd be going in short-handed, you know.
RHODEY: Look, he's still got the stones, so...
CAROL DANVERS: So let's get him... Use them to bring everyone back.
RHODEY: Just like that?
STEVE ROGERS: Yeah, just like that.
NATASHA ROMANOFF: Even if there's a small chance that we can undo this... I mean we owe it to everyone who's not in this room to try.
BRUCE BANNER: If we do this, how do we know it's gonna end any differently than it did before?
CAROL DANVERS: Because before, you didn't have me.
RHODEY: Hey, new girl, everyone here is about that superhero life. And if you don't mind my asking, where the hell have you been all this time?
CAROL DANVERS: There are a lot of other planets in the universe. And unfortunately, they didn't have you guys.
Thor: I like this one.
STEVE ROGERS: Let's go get this son of a bitch.
ROCKET: Okay, who here hasn't been to space?
RHODEY: Why?
ROCKET: You better not throw up on my ship.
NEBULA: Approaching jump in 3... 2... 1!
CAROL DANVERS: I'll head down for recon.
NATASHA ROMANOFF: This is gonna work, Steve.
STEVE ROGERS: I know it will.
STEVE ROGERS: Cause I don't know what I'm going to do if it doesn't.
CAROL DANVERS: No satellites, no ships, no armies, no ground defenses of any kind. It's just him.
NEBULA: And that's enough.
ROCKET: Oh no.
STEVE ROGERS: Where are they?
CAROL DANVERS: Answer the question!
THANOS: The universe required correction. After that, the stones served no purpose, beyond temptation.
BRUCE BANNER: You murdered trillions!
THANOS: You should be grateful.
NATASHA ROMANONFF: Where are the Stones?
THANOS: Gone. Reduced to atoms.
BRUCE BANNER: You used them two days ago!
THANOS: I used the stones to destroy the stones. It nearly killed me. But the work is done. It always will be.  I am... inevitable.
RHODEY: We have to tear this place apart, he-he-he has to be lying.
NEBULA: My father is many things. A liar is not one of them.
THANOS: Ah, thank you, daughter.  Perhaps I treated you too harshly.
ROCKET: What... What did you do?
THOR: I went for the head.
FIVE
YEARS
LATER
JOE RUSSO: So I, uh... Went on a date the other day. It's the first time in five years, you know? I'm sitting there at dinner... I didn't even know what to talk about.
STEVE ROGERS: What did you talk about?
JOE RUSSO: Same old crap, you know? How things have changed, and... my job, his job... How much we miss the Mets. And then things get quiet... He cried as they were serving the salads.
JIM STARLIN: What about you?
JOE RUSSO: I cried... just before dessert. But I'm seeing him again tomorrow, so...
STEVE ROGERS: That's great. You did the hardest part. You took the jump, you didn't know where you were gonna come down. And that's it. That's those little brave baby steps we gotta take. To try and become whole again, try and find purpose. I went in the ice in '45 right after I met the love of my life. Woke up 70 years later. You gotta move on. Gotta to move on. The world is in our hands. It's left to us guys, and we got to do something with it. Otherwise... Thanos should have killed all of us.
Scott Lang:  What the hell?
Scott Lang: Hope?
reading a book as he looks upon his security screen, seeing something going on in one of the storage facilities. In the cameras, it shows Lang in his casual clothing, shouting, waving a sign with the word "HELP" written on it.)
Scott Lang:  Kid! Hey kid!
Scott Lang: What the hell happened here?
Scott Lang: No. Please. Please, please.  No, no, no. No.  Excuse me, sorry. No, Cassie, no.
Scott Lang:  Please, please, please, please... No, Cassie.
Scott Lang: What?
SCOTT LANG: Cassie?
CASSIE LANG: Dad?
SCOTT LANG: You're so big!
ROCKET: Yeah, we boarded that highly suspect warship Danvers pinged.
NEBULA: It was an infectious garbage scowl.
ROCKET: So, thanks for the hot tip.
CAROL DANVERS: Well, you were closer.
ROCKET: Yeah. And now we smell like garbage.
NATASHA ROMANOFF:  You get a reading on those tremors?
OKOYE: It was a mild subduction under the African plate.
NATASHA ROMANOFF: Do we have a visual? How are we handling it?
OKOYE: Nat, it's an earthquake under the ocean. We handle it by not handling it.
NATASHA ROMANOFF:  Carol, are we seeing you here next month?
CAROL DANVERS: Not likely.
ROCKET: What, you gonna get another haircut?
CAROL DANVERS:  Listen fur-face, I'm covering a lot of territory. The things that are happening on Earth, are happening everywhere, on thousands of planets.
ROCKET:  All right, all right, that's a good point. That's a good point.
CAROL DANVERS: So you might not see me for a long time.
NATASHA ROMANOFF: Alright. Uh, well. This channel is always active. So, if anything goes sideways... anyone's making trouble where they shouldn't... comes through me.
ROCKET: Okay.
NATASHA ROMANOFF: Alright.
CAROL DANVERS:  Good luck.
NATASHA ROMANOFF: Where are you?
RHODEY: Mexico. The Federales found a room full of bodies. Looks like a bunch of cartel guys. Never even had the chance to get their guns off.
NATASHA ROMANOFF: It's probably a rival gang.
RHODEY: Except it isn't.  It's definitely Barton. What he's done here, what he's been doing for the last few years... I mean, the scene that he left...  I gotta tell you, there's a part of me that doesn't even want to find him.
NATASHA ROMANOFF: Will you find out where he's going next?
RHODEY: Nat...
NATASHA ROMANOFF: Please.
RHODEY:  Okay.
STEVE ROGERS: You know I'd offer to cook you dinner but you seem pretty miserable already.
NATASHA ROMANOFF: You here to do your laundry?
STEVE ROGERS: And to see a friend.
NATASHA ROMANOFF: Clearly, your friend is fine.
STEVE ROGERS: You know I saw a pod of whales when I was coming up the bridge.
NATASHA ROMANOFF: In the Hudson?
STEVE ROGERS: There's fewer ships, cleaner water.
NATASHA ROMANOFF: You know, if you're about to tell me to look on the bright side. Um... I'm about you to hit you in the head with a peanut butter sandwich.
STEVE ROGERS: Sorry. Force of habit.
STEVE ROGERS: You know, I keep telling everybody they should move on and... grow. Some do. But not us.
NATASHA ROMANOFF: If I move on, who does this?
STEVE ROGERS: Maybe it doesn't need to be done.
NATASHA ROMANOFF:  I used to have nothing. And then I got this. This job... this family. And I was... I was better because of it. And even though... they're gone... I'm still trying to be better.
STEVE ROGERS: I think we both need to get a life.
NATASHA ROMANOFF:  You first.
Scott Lang: Oh! Hi. Hi! Is anyone home? This is Scott Lang. We met a few years ago, at the airport? In Germany? I got really big, and I had my mask on. You wouldn't recognize me.
STEVE ROGERS:  Is this an old message?
NATASHA ROMANOFF:  It's the front gate.
SCOTT LANG: Ant-Man? Ant-Man, I know you know that. I need to talk to you guys.
STEVE ROGERS: Scott. Are you okay?
SCOTT LANG: Yeah. I'm fine.
SCOTT LANG: Have you ever studied Quantum Physics?
NATASHA ROMANOFF: Only to make conversation.
SCOTT LANG: Alright. So... five years ago, right before Thanos, I was in a place called the Quantum Realm. The Quantum Realm is like its own microscopic universe. To get in there, you have to be incredibly small. Hope, she's my... She was my...  She was supposed to pull me out. And then Thanos happened, and I got stuck in there.
NATASHA ROMANOFF: I'm sorry. That must've been a very long five years.
SCOTT LANG: Yeah, but that's just it. It wasn't. For me, it was five hours.
SCOTT LANG: See, the rules of the Quantum Realm aren't like they are up here. Everything is unpredictable. Is that anybody's sandwich? I'm starving.
STEVE ROGERS: Scott, what are you talking about?
SCOTT LANG: What I'm saying is, time works differently in the Quantum Realm. The only problem is right now, we don't have a way to navigate it. But what if we did? I can't stop thinking about it. What if, we could somehow control the chaos, and we could navigate it? What if there was a way to enter the Quantum Realm at a certain point in time but then exit at another point in time? Like... Like before Thanos.
STEVE ROGERS: Wait, are you talking about a time machine?
SCOTT LANG: No. No, of course not. No, not a time machine. It's more like a... Yeah, a time machine. I know it's crazy. But I can't stop thinking about it. There's gotta be some way... There's gotta be...some w... it's crazy.
NATASHA ROMANOFF: Scott, I get e-mails from a raccoon, so nothing sounds crazy anymore.
SCOTT LANG: So who do we talk to about this?
Tony Stark:  Chow time!  Maguna? Morgan H. Stark. You want some lunch?
MORGAN STARK: Define lunch or be disintegrated.
Tony Stark: Okay, You should not be wearing that, okay? That is part of a special anniversary gift I'm making for Mom.
MORGAN STARK: Okay.
Tony Stark: There you go. Are you thinking about lunch? I can give you a handful of crickets on a bed of lettuce.
MORGAN STARK: No.
Tony Stark: That's what you want. How did you find this?
MORGAN STARK: Garage.
Tony Stark: Really? Were you looking for it?
MORGAN STARK: No. I found it, though.
Tony Stark: You like going to the garage, huh? So does daddy. It's fine, actually. Your mom never wears anything I buy her.
SCOTT LANG:  Now, we know what it sounds like...
STEVE ROGERS: Tony, after everything you've seen, is anything really impossible?
Tony Stark: Quantum fluctuation messes with the Planck Scale, which then triggers the Deutsch Proposition. Can we agree on that?
STEVE ROGERS:  Thank you.
Tony Stark: In Layman's terms, it means you're not coming home.
SCOTT LANG: I did.
Tony Stark: No, you accidentally survived. It's a billion to one cosmic fluke. And now you wanna pull off a... What do you call it?
SCOTT LANG:  A time heist?
Tony Stark: Yeah, a time heist. Of course, why didn't we think of this before? Oh, because it's laughable? Because it's a pipedream?
SCOTT LANG: The Stones are in the past. We can go back and get them.
NATASHA ROMANOFF: We can snap our own fingers. We can bring everyone back.
Tony Stark: Or screw it up worse than he already has, right?
STEVE ROGERS: I don't believe we would.
Tony Stark: Gotta say, sometimes I miss that giddy optimism. However, high hopes won't help if there's no logical, tangible way for me to safely execute said time heist. I believe the most likely outcome would be our collective demise.
SCOTT LANG: Not if we strictly follow the rules of time travel. That means no talking to our past selves, no betting on sporting events -
Tony Stark: I'm gonna stop you right there, Scott. Are you seriously telling me that your plan to save the universe is based on Back To The Future?
SCOTT LANG:  No.
Tony Stark: Good. You had me worried there. 'Cause that'd be horse shit. That's not how quantum physics works.
NATASHA ROMANOFF: Tony... We have to take a stand.
Tony Stark: We did stand. And yet, here we are.
SCOTT LANG: I know you got a lot on the line. You got a wife, a daughter. But I lost someone very important to me. A lot of people did.  And now, now we have a chance to bring her back. To bring everyone back. And you're telling me that won't even...
Tony Stark: That's right, Scott, I won't even. I got a kid.
MORGAN STARK: Mommy told me to come and save you.
Tony Stark: Good job. I'm saved.  I wish you'd come here to ask me something else. Anything else. Honestly, I... I missed you guys, it was... Oh, and table's set for six.
STEVE ROGERS: Tony, I get it. And I'm happy for you, I really am. But this is a second chance. Tony Stark: I got my second chance right here, Cap. I can't roll the dice again. If you don't talk shop, you can stay for lunch.
NATASHA ROMANOFF: He's scared.
STEVE ROGERS: He's not wrong.
SCOTT LANG: Yeah, but I mean, what are we gonna do? We need him. What, are we gonna stop?
STEVE ROGERS: No, I wanna do it right. We're gonna need a really big brain.
SCOTT LANG:  Bigger than his?
BRUCE BANNER: Come on, I feel like I'm the only one eating.  Try some of that. Have some eggs.
SCOTT LANG: I'm so confused.
BRUCE BANNER:  These are confusing times.
SCOTT LANG: Right. No, no, that's not what I meant.
BRUCE BANNER:  No, I get it. I'm kidding! I know. It's crazy. I'm wearing shirts now.
SCOTT LANG: Yeah! Wh...How? Why?
BRUCE BANNER: Five years ago, we got our asses beaten. Except it was worse for me. Because I lost twice. First, Hulk lost, then Banner lost. Then, we all lost.
NATASHA ROMANOFF: No one blamed you, Bruce.
BRUCE BANNER: I did. For years, I've been treating the Hulk like he's some kind of disease, something to get rid of. But then I started looking at him as the cure. Eighteen months in a gamma lab. I put the brains and the brawn together. And now look at me. Best of both worlds...
GIRL: Excuse me, Mr. Hulk?
BRUCE BANNER: Yes?
GIRL: Can we get a photo?
BRUCE BANNER: 100%, little person. Come on, step up.  You mind?
SCOTT LANG: Oh, yeah.
BRUCE BANNER: Thanks,  Say "green"!
BRUCE BANNER: Did you get that?
SCOTT LANG:  Don't you wanna grab one with me? I'm Ant-Man.
SCOTT LANG: They're Hulk fans, they don't know Ant-Man. Nobody does.
BRUCE BANNER: Wait, no, no, he feels bad. No, he wants you to...he wants to... You want to take a picture with him, right?
BOY: Stranger Danger.
SCOTT LANG: He's even saying no he doesn't. I get it. I don't want it either.
BRUCE BANNER: But, come on, the kid! But he...but you...
SCOTT LANG: I don't want a picture with them.
BRUCE BANNER:  He's gonna feel bad.  Sorry. They said they'd do it.
SCOTT LANG: I don't want it anymore.
BRUCE BANNER: No, no...you feel bad.
SCOTT LANG: Just take the goddamn phone.
GIRL: Thank you, Mr. Hulk.
BRUCE BANNER: No, it's great kids. Thank you very much.  Hulk out!
STEVE ROGERS: Bruce.
BRUCE BANNER:  Dab!
STEVE ROGERS: Bruce.
BRUCE BANNER: Listen to your Mom. She knows better.
STEVE ROGERS: About we were saying...
BRUCE BANNER: Right. The whole time travel do-over? Guys, it's outside my area of expertise.
NATASHA ROMANOFF: Well, you pulled this off. I remember a time when that seemed pretty impossible time, too.
Tony Stark: Look at a mod inspiration, let me see what check out. So, recommend one last sim before we pack it in for the night. This time, in the shape of a mobius strip, inverted, please.
F.R.I.D.A.Y: Processing...
Tony Stark: Give me that eigenvalue. That, particle factoring, and a spectral decomp. That will take a second.
F.R.I.D.A.Y: Just a moment.
Tony Stark: And don't worry if it doesn't pan out. I'm just kinda -
F.R.I.D.A.Y: Model rendered.
Tony Stark: Shit!
MORGAN STARK: Shit.
Tony Stark:  What are you doing up, little mess?
MORGAN STARK: Shit.
Tony Stark: No, we don't say that. Only Mommy says that word. She coined it, it belongs to her.
MORGAN STARK: Why you up?
Tony Stark: 'Cause I got some important shit going on here.  What do you think? No, I got something on my mind. I got something on my mind.
MORGAN STARK: Was it Juice Pops?
Tony Stark: Sure was. That's extortion. Great minds think alike. Juice Pops, exactly was on...  my mind.
Tony Stark: You done? Yeah, now you are.  That face goes there.
MORGAN STARK: Tell me a story.
Tony Stark: A story... Once upon a time, Maguna went to bed. The end.
MORGAN STARK:  That's a horrible story.
Tony Stark: Come on, that's your favorite story. I love you tons.
MORGAN STARK: I love you 3000.
Tony Stark:  Wow.  3000. That's crazy.  Go to bed. Or I'll sell all your toys. Night, night.
Tony Stark: Not that it's a competition, but she loves me 3000. You were somewhere on the low 6 to 900 range.
Tony Stark:  What are you reading?
PEPPER POTTS: Oh, it's just a book on composting.
Tony Stark:  What's new with composting?
PEPPER POTTS: Just -
Tony Stark: I figured it out, by the way.
PEPPER POTTS: You know, just so we're talking about the same thing -
Tony Stark: Time travel.
PEPPER POTTS:  What? Wow... That's amazing, and... terrifying.
Tony Stark: That's right.
PEPPER POTTS: We got really lucky.
Tony Stark: Yeah, I know.
PEPPER POTTS: A lot of people didn't.
Tony Stark: No, I can't help everybody.
PEPPER POTTS: It sort a seems like you can.
Tony Stark: Not if I stop. I can put a pin in it right now, and stop.
PEPPER POTTS: Tony, trying to get you to stop has been one of the few failures of my life.
Tony Stark: I sometimes feel I should put it in a locked box and drop it at the bottom of a lake... go to bed.
PEPPER POTTS: But would you be able to rest?
BRUCE BANNER: Okay, here we go. Time travel test number one. Scott, fire up the uhhh... the van thing.
STEVE ROGERS: Breakers are set, emergency generators are on standby.
BRUCE BANNER: Good. 'Cause if we blow the grid, I don't wanna lose Tiny here in the 1950's.
SCOTT LANG: Excuse me?
NATASHA ROMANOFF: He's kidding.  You can't say things like that!
BRUCE BANNER: Just... It was a bad joke.
NATASHA ROMANOFF: You were kidding, right?
BRUCE BANNER:  I have no idea. We're talking about time travel here. Either it's all a joke, or none of it is.  We're good! Get your helmet on, Scott. I'm gonna send you back a week, let you walk around for an hour, then bring you back in 10 seconds. Makes sense?
SCOTT LANG: Perfectly not confusing.
STEVE ROGERS: Good luck, Scott. You got this.
SCOTT LANG: You're right. I do, Captain America.
BRUCE BANNER: On the count of three. 3... 2... 1!
TEEN SCOTT LANG: Uh, guys? This...this doesn't feel right.
STEVE ROGERS: What is this?
BRUCE BANNER: What's going on?
NATASHA ROMANOFF: That...who is that?
BRUCE BANNER: Hold on.
NATASHA ROMANOFF: Is that Scott?
TEEN SCOTT LANG: Yes, it's Scott!
OLD SCOTT LANG: Ow! My back!
STEVE ROGERS: What is this?
BRUCE BANNER: Can I get a little space here.
STEVE ROGERS: Yeah yeah. Can you bring him back?
BRUCE BANNER: I'm working on it!
STEVE ROGERS: It's a baby.
BRUCE BANNER: It's Scott.
STEVE ROGERS: As a baby!
BRUCE BANNER: He'll grow.
STEVE ROGERS: Bring Scott back!
BRUCE BANNER:  When I say kill the power, kill the power.
NATASHA ROMANOFF: Oh my god.
BRUCE BANNER: And... Kill it!
SCOTT LANG: Somebody peed my pants.
NATASHA ROMANOFF: Oh thank god.
SCOTT LANG: But I don't know if it was "baby" me or "old" me...Or just "me" me.
BRUCE BANNER:  Time travel!
BRUCE BANNER: What? I..I see this as an absolute win!
Tony Stark: Why the long face? Let me guess: He turned into a baby.
STEVE ROGERS: Among other things, yeah. What are you doing here?
Tony Stark:  That's the EPR Paradox. Instead of pushing Lang through time, you might've wound up pushing time through Lang. It's tricky. Dangerous. Somebody should've cautioned you against it.
STEVE ROGERS: You did.
Tony Stark: Oh, did I?  Thank God I'm here. Regardless, I fixed it.  A fully functioning Time-Space GPS. I just want peace.  Turns out, resentment is corrosive, and I hate it.
STEVE ROGERS: Me too.
Tony Stark: We got a shot at getting these stones, but I gotta tell you my priorities: Bring back what we lost? I hope, yes. Keep what I got? I have to, at all costs. And... maybe not die trying will be nice.
STEVE ROGERS: Sounds like a deal.
STEVE ROGERS: Tony...
Tony Stark: Why? He made it for you.  Plus, honestly I have to get it out of the garage before Morgan takes it sledding.
STEVE ROGERS: Thank you, Tony.
Tony Stark: Will you keep that a little quiet? Didn't bring one for the whole team.  ...We are getting the whole team, yeah?
STEVE ROGERS: We're working on that right now.
ROCKET: Hey, humie! Where's Big Green?
SCOTT LANG: Uh, Kitchen, I think.  That's awesome.
NEBULA:  Rhodey, careful on re-entry. There's an idiot on the landing zone.
SCOTT LANG: Oh, God!
RHODEY: What's up, regular sized man?
ROCKET: Kind of a step down from a golden palace and magic hammers and whatnot.
BRUCE BANNER: Hey, have a little compassion, pal. First they've lost Asgard, then half the people. They're probably just happy to have a home.
VALKYRIE: You shouldn't have come!
BRUCE BANNER: Ah, Valkyrie! Great to see you, Angry Girl.
VALKYRIE:  I think I liked you better either of the other ways.
BRUCE BANNER:  This is Rocket.
ROCKET: How you doin'?
VALKYRIE:  He won't see you.
BRUCE BANNER: That bad, huh?
VALKYRIE: We only see him once a month, when he comes for...  ... supplies.
BRUCE BANNER: It's that bad.
VALKYRIE: Yeah.
ROCKET:  What the... Woo! Something died in here.
BRUCE BANNER: Hello? Thor?
THOR:  Are you here about the cable?
THOR: The Cinemax ran out about two weeks ago, and the sports were all kind of fuzzy.
BRUCE BANNER: Thor?
THOR:  BOYS! Oh my God! Its so to see you!  Come here, you little rascal!
ROCKET: No, I'm good. I'm good. That's not necessary.
THOR: Hulk, you know my friends, Miek, Korg, right?
KORG: Hey boys!
BRUCE BANNER: Hey guys, long time no see.
KORG: Beer's on the bucket. Feel free to log on to the Wi-Fi. No password, obviously.  Thor, he's back. The kid on the TV that called me a dickhead again.
THOR: NoobMaster.
KORG: Yeah, NoobMaster69 called me a dickhead.
THOR: NoobMaster. Hey, it's Thor again. You know, the God of Thunder? Listen, buddy. If you don't log off this game immediately, I'm gonna fly over to your house, come down to that basement you're hiding in, rip off your arms and SHOVE THEM UP YOUR BUTT! Oh, that's right, go cry to your father, you little weasel!
KORG:  Thank you, Thor.
THOR: Let me know if he bothers you again, okay?
KORG: Thank you very much. I will.
THOR: So you guys want a drink? What are you drinking? We have beer, tequila, all sorts of things.
BRUCE BANNER: Buddy, you all right?
THOR: Yes, I'm fine! Why, don't I look all right?
ROCKET:  You look like melted ice cream.
THOR:  So, what's up?
BRUCE BANNER: We need your help. There might be a chance we could fix everything.
THOR: What, like the cable?  Cause that's been driving me bananas for weeks.
BRUCE BANNER: Like Thanos.
THOR: Don't say that name.
KORG: Um, yeah. We don't actually say that name in here.
BRUCE BANNER:  Please take your hand off me.  Now, I know that... guy might scare you.
THOR: Why would I be? Why would, why would I be scared of that guy? I'm the one who killed that guy, remember? Anyone else here killed that guy? Nope. Didn't think so. Korg, why don't you, tell everybody who chopped Thanos' big head off.
KORG: Umm... Stormbreaker?
THOR: Now, who's swingin' Stormbreaker?
BRUCE BANNER: I get it. You're in a rough spot, okay? I've been there myself. You wanna know who helped me out of it?
THOR: I don't know. Is it... Natasha?
BRUCE BANNER: It was you. You helped me.
THOR:  Why don't you ask the, Asgardians down there, how much my help was worth.  The ones that are left, anyway.
BRUCE BANNER: I think we can bring them back.
THOR: Stop. stop, okay?  I know you think I'm down here wallowing in my own self-pity, waiting to be rescued and and saved. But I'm fine, okay? We're fine, aren't we?
KORG: Nah, all good here, mate.
THOR: So, whatever it is that you're offering, we're not into it, don't care, couldn't care less. Goodbye.
BRUCE BANNER:  We need you, pal.
ROCKET:  There's beer on the ship.
THOR:  What kind?
THUG #1: あいつだ! アキヒコさんを！
AKIHIKO: てめえ なぜこんなことをする? 俺たちてめえになにもしてねぇだろ！
RONIN: 地球の半分 サノスにやられた... お前はなぜ無事なの…
RONIN:  お前はもう十分殺しただろ You're done hurting people.
AKIHIKO: 俺らがだと? 気でも狂ったか!
AKIHIKO:  死ね!
AKIHIKO: 待て! 助けてくれ! お前に何でもやる! 何が欲しい?
RONIN:  What I want... You can't give me.
CLINT BARTON: You shouldn't be here.
NATASHA ROMANOFF: Neither should you.
CLINT BARTON: I've got a job to do.
NATASHA ROMANOFF: Is that what you're calling this? Killing all these people isn't gonna bring your family back.
NATASHA ROMANOFF: We found something. A chance, maybe...
CLINT BARTON:  Don't...
NATASHA ROMANOFF: Don't what?
CLINT BARTON: ...don't give me hope.
NATASHA: I'm sorry I couldn't give it to you sooner.
Tony Stark:  Drifting left. On the side there, Lebowski.  Ratchet, How's it going?
ROCKET: It's Rocket. Take it easy. You're only a genius on Earth, pal.
RHODEY: Time travel suit? Not bad.
SCOTT LANG:  Hey, hey, hey! Easy, easy!
BRUCE BANNER: I'm being very careful.
SCOTT LANG: No, you're being very Hulky.
BRUCE BANNER: I'm being careful.
SCOTT LANG:  These are Pym Particles, alright? And ever since Hank Pym got snapped out of existence, this is it. This is what we have. We're not making any more.
RHODEY: Scott, calm down.
SCOTT LANG: Sorry. We've got enough for one round trip each. That's it. No do-overs. Plus two test runs.  One test run.
SCOTT LANG: All right. I'm not ready for this.
CLINT BARTON: I'm game. I'll do it.
BRUCE BANNER: Clint, now you're gonna feel a little discombobulated from the chronoshift. Don't worry about it.
RHODEY: Wai-Wait a second, let me ask you something. If we can do this, you know, go back in time, why don't we just find baby Thanos, you know, and...
BRUCE BANNER:  First of all, that's horrible...
RHODEY:  It's Thanos.
BRUCE BANNER: ...And secondly, time doesn't work that way. Changing the past doesn't change the future.
SCOTT LANG: Look, we go back, we get the stones before Thanos gets them... Thanos doesn't have the stones. Problem solved.
CLINT BARTON: Bingo.
NEBULA: That's not how it works.
CLINT BARTON: Well, that's what I heard.
BRUCE BANNER: What? By who? Who told you that?
RHODEY:  Star Trek, Terminator, TimeCop, Time After Time -
SCOTT LANG: Quantum Leap -
RHODEY: A Wrinkle in Time, Somewhere in Time -
SCOTT LANG: Hot Tub Time Machine -
RHODEY: Hot Tub Time Machine. Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure. Basically, any movie that deals with time travel.
SCOTT LANG: Die Hard? No, it's not one...
RHODEY: This is known.
BRUCE BANNER: I don't know why everyone believes that, but that isn't true. Think about it: If you travel to the past, that past becomes your future. And your former present becomes the past. Which can't now be changed by your new future...
NEBULA: Exactly.
SCOTT LANG: So... Back To The Future's a bunch of bullshit?
BRUCE BANNER:  Alright, Clint. We're going in 3... 2... 1!
LILA BARTON:  Cooper? Where are my headphones?
CLINT BARTON:  Lila?  Lila!
LILA BARTON: Yeah, Dad?  Dad?
NATASHA ROMANOFF: Hey, hey. Look at me. You okay?
CLINT BARTON:  Yeah, it worked. It worked.
STEVE ROGERS: Okay, so the "how" works. Now we gotta figure out the when and the where. Almost all of us has had an encounter with at least one of the six Infinity Stones.
Tony Stark: Well I'd substitute the word encounter for damn well near been killed by one of the six Infinity Stones.
SCOTT LANG: I haven't, I don't even know what the hell you're all talking about.
BRUCE BANNER: Regardless, we only have enough Pym Particles for one round trip each, and these stones have been in a lot of different places throughout history.
Tony Stark: Our history. So, not a lot of convenient spots to just drop in.
CLINT BARTON: Which means we have to pick our targets.
Tony Stark: Correct.
STEVE ROGERS: Let's start with the Aether. Thor, what do you know?
NATASHA ROMANOFF: Is he asleep?
RHODEY: No, I'm pretty sure he's dead.
THOR: Where to start? Umm... The Aether, first, is not a stone, someone called it a stone before. It's more of a... an angry sludge thing, so... someones gonna need to amend that. Here's an interesting story though, many years ago... My grandfather had to hide the stones from the Dark Elves...  Wooooh, scary beings. So Jane,  Oh, there she is. That's Jane... She's... an old flame of mine... She... she stuck her hand inside a rock this one time... and then the Aether stuck itself inside her... And, she became very, very sick. So I had to take her to Asgard, which is where I'm from. And we had to try and fix her. We were dating at the time, you see. I got to introduce her to my Mother... who's dead,  and oh you know, Jane and I aren't even dating anymore, these things happen though you know, nothing last forever,  I'm not done yet, the only thing permanent in life is impermanence.
Tony Stark: Awesome. Eggs? Breakfast?
THOR: I'd like a Bloody Mary, thank you.
ROCKET: Quill said he stole the Power Stone from Morag.
SCOTT LANG: Is that a person?
ROCKET: Morag's a planet. Quill was a person.
SCOTT LANG: A planet? Like in outer space?
ROCKET: Oh, look. It's like a little puppy, all happy and everything.  Do you wanna go to space? You wanna go to space, puppy? I'll get you to space.
NEBULA: Thanos found the Soul Stone on Vormir.
NATASHA ROMANOFF:  What is Vormir?
NEBULA: A dominion of death, at the very center of Celestial existence. It's where... Thanos murdered my sister.
SCOTT LANG: Not it.
NATASHA ROMANOFF: That Time Stone guy...
BRUCE BANNER: Doctor Strange.
NATASHA ROMANOFF: Yeah, what kind of doctor was he?
Tony Stark: Ear-nose-throat meets rabbit from a hat.
BRUCE BANNER: Nice place in the village, though.
Tony Stark: Yeah. Sullivan Street.
BRUCE BANNER: Hmm... Bleecker.
NATASHA ROMANOFF: Wait, he lived in New York?
Tony Stark: No. He lived in Toronto. Were you even paying attention?
NATASHA ROMANOFF: Guys, if you pick the right year, there are three stones in New York.
BRUCE BANNER:  Shut the front door.
STEVE ROGERS: All right. We have a plan. Six Stones, three teams. One shot.
STEVE ROGERS: Five years ago, we lost. All of us. We lost friends... We lost family... We lost a part of ourselves. Today, we have a chance to take it all back. You know your teams, you know your missions. Get the stones, get them back. One round trip each. No mistakes. No do-overs. Most of us are going somewhere we know. But it doesn't mean we should know what to expect. Be careful. Look out for each other. This is the fight of our lives. And we're gonna win.  Whatever it takes. Good luck.
ROCKET: He's pretty good at that.
SCOTT LANG: Right?
Tony Stark: All right. You heard the man. Stroke those keys, jolly green.
BRUCE BANNER: Tractors engaged.
ROCKET:  You promise to bring that back in one piece, right?
CLINT BARTON: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. I'll do my best.
ROCKET: As promises go, that was pretty lame.
NATASHA ROMANOFF:  See you in a minute.
STEVE ROGERS: All right, we all have our assignments. Two Stones uptown, one Stone, down. Stay low. Keep an eye on the clock.
STEVE ROGERS: Feel free to smash a few things along the way.
BRUCE BANNER: I think it's gratuitous, but whatever.
THE ANCIENT ONE : I'd be careful going that way. We just had the floors waxed.
BRUCE BANNER: I'm looking for Doctor Strange.
THE ANCIENT ONE : You're about... five years too early. Stephen Strange is currently performing surgery about twenty blocks that way. What do you want from him?
BRUCE BANNER: That, actually.
looks at it]
THE ANCIENT ONE : Ah! I'm afraid not.
BRUCE BANNER: Sorry, but I wasn't asking.
THE ANCIENT ONE : You don't wanna do this.
BRUCE BANNER: Ah, you're right, I don't.  But I need that stone, and I don't have time to beat it-
pushes Bruce's astral form out of his body. Bruce who's is now in astral form looks at The Ancient One horrified.]
THE ANCIENT ONE : Let's start over, shall we?
THOR: That's Jane.
ROCKET: All right. Here's the deal, Tubby: You're gonna charm her and I'm gonna poke her with this thing,  and extract the Reality Stone and get gone, lickety-split.
THOR: I'll be right back, okay? There's a wine cellar, that's just down there. My father used to have this huge barrel of Aakonian ale. I'll see if the scullery has a couple of to-go cups...
ROCKET: Hey! Hey! Aren't you drunk enough already?
walking. Thor sees his mother.]
ROCKET: Who's the fancy broad?
THOR: It's my Mother. She dies today.
ROCKET: Oh. That's today?
THOR: I can't do this. I can't do this. I shouldn't be here. I shouldn't have come.This was a bad idea.
ROCKET: Come here.
THOR: No, no, no. I think I'm having...I'm having a panic attack. I shouldn't be here...this is...this is a bad-
ROCKET: Come here. Right here.
ROCKET: You think you're the only one who lost people? What do you think we're doing here? I lost the only family I ever had. Quill, Groot, Drax, the chick with the antenna, all gone. Now, I get you miss your Mom. But she's gone. Really gone. And there are plenty of people who are only kinda gone. But you can help them. So is it too much to ask that you brush the crumbs outta your beard, make schmoopy talk to Pretty Pants, and when she's not looking, suck out the Infinity Stone and help me get my family back?
THOR: Okay.
ROCKET: Are you crying?
THOR: No...Yes!
ROCKET: Get it together! You can do this. You can do this. All right?
THOR: Yes, I can.
ROCKET: Good.
THOR: I can do this. I can do it, I can't do this.
ROCKET: Alright, Heartbreaker. She's alone. This is our shot.  Thor? Thor! Aaagh!!!
RHODEY: Alright. Bring it down low. Right on that line. That's it. Down, down.
CLINT BARTON: Hey, can we hurry it up?
NATASHA ROMANOFF: Guys, chop-chop. Come on. We're on a clock.
[Nebula walks out of the ship, apparently having directed it to its next destination.
RHODEY: All that, is really helpful.  Take care, okay?
NATASHA ROMANOFF: Yeah.
RHODEY: Take that stone and come back. No messing around.
CLINT BARTON:  Hey. You got this.
RHODEY: Let's get it done. Yes, sir.
NATASHA ROMANOFF:  See you back.
RHODEY: You guys watch each other's six.
CLINT BARTON: Yeah.
NEBULA: The coordinates for Vormir are laid in. All they have to do is not fall out.
CLINT BARTON: It's a long way from Budapest.
RHODEY: Okay, so, uhh... We just wait around for this Quill guy to show up and then he leads us to the Power Stone, is that it?
NEBULA:  Let's take cover. We're not the only ones in 2014 looking for the stones.
RHODEY: Wait a minute, what are you talking about right now? Who else is looking for these stones?
NEBULA: My father, my sister... and me.
RHODEY: And you? Where are you right now?
and Nebula  fighting some Korbinite soldiers.]
GAMORA :  You're welcome.
NEBULA : I didn't ask for your help.
GAMORA : And yet, you always need it.  laughs and Gamora's hand.] Get up. Father wants us back on the ship.
NEBULA : Why?
GAMORA : He's found an Infinity Stone.
NEBULA : Where?
GAMORA : On a planet called Morag.
NEBULA : Father's plan is finally in motion.
GAMORA : One stone isn't six, Nebula.
NEBULA : It’s a start.
GAMORA : If he gets all of them...
arrives, honking badass double-bladed sword in tow and healthy coating blood of his armour.]
THANOS : Ronan's located the Power Stone. I'm dispatching you to his ship.
GAMORA : He won't like that.
THANOS : His alternative is death, then.  Ronan's obsession clouds his judgement.
NEBULA : We will not fail you, Father.
rolls her eyes]
THANOS : No, you won't.
NEBULA : I swear...I will make you proud.
is suddenly in pain and opens up future Nebula's memories.]
RHODEY : We just, wait around for this Quill guy to show up, and then he leads us to the Power Stone, is that it?
NEBULA : Let's take cover. We're not the only ones in 2014 looking for the stones.
shuts off the memory]
GAMORA : Who was that?
NEBULA : I don't know...My head is splitting...I don't know...
GAMORA : Her synaptic drive was probably damaged in battle.
THANOS : Shhh...  Bring her to my ship.
Tony Stark: Got to hustle, Cap. Things look like they're just about wrapped up here.
STEVE ROGERS: Got it. I'm approaching the elevator now.
LOKI : If it's all the same to you... I'll have that drink now.
Tony Stark: All right, get him on his feet. We can all stand around posing up a storm later. By the way, feel free to clean up.
Tony Stark: Uh, Mr. Rogers. I almost forgot that that suit  did nothing for your ass.
STEVE ROGERS: No one asked you to look, Tony.
Tony Stark:  It's ridiculous.
SCOTT LANG: I think you look great, Cap. As far as I'm concerned, that's America's ass.
NATASHA ROMANOFF : Who gets the, uh, magic wand?
Tony Stark: STRIKE team's coming to secure it.
SITWELL : We can take that  off your hands.
NATASHA ROMANOFF : By all means. Careful with that thing.
CLINT BARTON : Unless you want your mind erased. And not in a fun way.
SITWELL : We promise to be careful.
SCOTT LANG: Who are these guys?
Tony Stark: They are SHIELD...Well, actually Hydra. But, we didn't know that yet.
SCOTT LANG: Seriously, you didn't? I mean...they look like bad guys.
Tony Stark: You're small, but you're talking loud.
STEVE ROGERS : On my way down to coordinate search and rescue.
LOKI :  On my way down to coordinate search and rescue!  I mean, honestly! How do you think you'll be...
THOR :  Shut up.
Tony Stark: All right, you're up, little buddy.  There's our stone.
SCOTT LANG:  Alright. Flick me.
HULK : Move.
THOR : Whoa!
Tony Stark: Whoa, whoa. Hey! Buddy. What do you think? Maximum occupancy has been reached.
THOR : Take the stairs.
Tony Stark: Yeah.  Stop. Stop!
HULK :  Take the stairs! Hate the stairs!
Tony Stark: All right, Cap. I got our scepter in the elevator just passing the 80th floor.
STEVE ROGERS: On it. Head to the lobby.
Tony Stark: Alright. I'll see you there.
SITWELL : Evidence secure. We're en route to Dr. List. No. No hitches at all, Mr. Secretary.
SITWELL : Captain. I thought you were coordinating search and rescue?
STEVE ROGERS: Change of plans.
RUMLOW : Hey, Cap.
STEVE ROGERS: Rumlow.  I just got a call from the Secretary. I'm gonna be running point on the scepter.
SITWELL : Sir? I don't understand.
STEVE ROGERS: We got word there may be an attempt to steal it.
RUMLOW : Sorry, Cap. I can't give you the scepter.
SITWELL : I'm gonna have to call the Director.
STEVE ROGERS: That's okay. Trust me.  Hail Hydra.
HULK :  So many stairs!
Tony Stark: Thumbelina, do you copy? I've got eyes on the prize. It's go-time.
SCOTT LANG: Bombs away.  Is... is that Axe body spray?
Tony Stark: Yeah, I had a can just for emergencies. Relax. Can we focus, please?
SCOTT LANG: I'm going inside you. Now.
ALEXANDER PIERCE : May I ask you where you're going?
THOR : To lunch and then Asgard. I'm sorry, you are?
Tony Stark: Alexander Pierce. He's the man, one of the folks behind Nick Fury.
ALEXANDER PIERCE : My friends call me Mr. Secretary. I'm gonna have to ask you to turn that prisoner over to me.
THOR : Loki will be answering to Odin himself.
ALEXANDER PIERCE : Oh, he's gonna answer to us. Odin can have what's left. And I'm gonna need that case, that's been SHIELD property for over 70 years.
HYDRA AGENT: Hand over the case, Stark.
Tony Stark:  All right, move it, Stuart Little. Things are getting dicey up here. Let's go.
Tony Stark: I'm not gonna argue who's got the higher authority here, all right?
SCOTT LANG: You promise me you won't die?
Tony Stark: You're only giving me a mild cardiac dysrhythmia.
SCOTT LANG: That doesn't sound mild.
ALEXANDER PIERCE : I need the case.
Tony Stark: I know you got a lotta pull. I'm just saying...
ALEXANDER PIERCE : Okay. Then give me the case.
Tony Stark: Do it, Lang!
Tony Stark: Get your hands off!
Tony Stark: Window's closing. Pull my pin!
SCOTT LANG: Here goes!
drops the case]
ALEXANDER PIERCE : Stark?
THOR : Stark!
ALEXANDER PIERCE : Look, he's convulsing. Give him air! Medic!
Tony Stark: MEDIC! You guys, some help!
ALEXANDER PIERCE : Stark, you--- your chest machine?
Tony Stark: Good job. Meet me in the alley. I'm gonna grab a quick slice.
HULK : NO STAIRS!!!!
THOR : You'll be fine, Stark. Stay with us! I'll try something, okay? I have no idea if it's gonna work.
THOR : YES!
Tony Stark: That worked a treat. That was so crazy!
THOR : I had no idea if that was gonna work.
Tony Stark: The case?
THOR : The case. It's, uhh... Where's the case? Where's Loki? Loki!
SCOTT LANG: That wasn't supposed to happen, was it?
Tony Stark: Oh, we blew it.
THOR : Loki!?
STEVE ROGERS: Tony, what's going on? Tell me you found that cube.  Oh, you gotta be shitting me.
STEVE ROGERS : I have eyes on Loki. 14th floor.
STEVE ROGERS:  I'm not Loki. And I don't wanna hurt you.
STEVE ROGERS : I can do this all day.
STEVE ROGERS:  Yeah, I know. I know.

STEVE ROGERS: That is America's ass.
. As Hulk is lying down on a beach chair who looks like he's sleeping with a hat on, Bruce Banner tries reasoning with the Ancient One to let him have the Time Stone.]
BRUCE BANNER: Please, please!
THE ANCIENT ONE : I'm sorry, I can't help you, Bruce. If I give up the Time Stone to help your Reality, I'm dooming my own.
BRUCE BANNER: With all due respect, I'm not sure the science really supports that.
THE ANCIENT ONE : The Infinity Stones create what you experience as the flow of time. Remove one stone and that flow splits.  Now, this may benefit your reality, but my new one…not so much. In this new branched Reality, without our chief weapon against the forces of darkness, our world will be overrun. Millions will suffer. So, tell me, Doctor, can your science prevent all that?
BRUCE BANNER: No, but we can erase it. Because once we are done with the stones, we can return each one to its own timeline at the moment it was taken. So, chronologically,  in that reality,  it never left.
THE ANCIENT ONE :  But you are leaving out the most important part. In order to return the stones, you have to survive.
BRUCE BANNER: We will. I will. I promise.
THE ANCIENT ONE : I can't risk this Reality on a promise. It is the duty of the Sorcerer Supreme to protect the Time Stone.
BRUCE BANNER: Then, why the hell did Strange give it away?
THE ANCIENT ONE :  What did you say?
BRUCE BANNER: Strange, he gave it away. He gave it to Thanos.
THE ANCIENT ONE : Willingly?
BRUCE BANNER: Yes!
THE ANCIENT ONE : ...Why?
BRUCE BANNER: I have no idea. Maybe he made a mistake.
THE ANCIENT ONE : Or I did.  Strange is meant to be the best of us.
BRUCE BANNER: So he must have done it for a reason.
THE ANCIENT ONE : I fear you might be right.
BRUCE BANNER: Thank you.
THE ANCIENT ONE : I'm counting on you, Bruce. We all are.
, Nebula , Gamora  and Ebony Maw  on the Sanctuary II.]
THANOS :  Run diagnostics. Show me her memory file.
EBONY MAW : Sire, the file appears entangled. It was a memory, but not hers. There's another consciousness sharing her network...another Nebula.
THANOS : Impossible.
EBONY MAW : This duplicate carries a time stamp... from nine years in the future.
THANOS : Where is this other Nebula?
EBONY MAW : In our solar system. On Morag.
THANOS : Can you access her?
EBONY MAW : Yes. The two are linked.
THANOS : Search the duplicate's memories for Infinity Stones.
BRUCE BANNER : And these stones have been in a lot of different places throughout history.
Tony Stark: Our history. So, not a lot of convenient spots to just drop in.
CLINT BARTON : Which means we have to pick our targets.
Tony Stark: Correct.
THANOS :  Freeze image.
GAMORA : Terrans.
THANOS : Avengers. Unruly wretches. What's that reflection? Amplify this, Maw.
GAMORA : ] I don't understand. Two Nebulas.
THANOS : No. The same Nebula. From two different times. Set course for Morag. Scan the duplicate's memories. I want to see everything.
FRIGGA : My ladies, I'll see you after. Go on.
FRIGGA :  What are you doing?
THOR: Aah!!!
FRIGGA : Aah!!!
THOR: OH, God!
FRIGGA : You're better off leaving the sneaking to your brother.
THOR: Yeah, I was simply just going for a walk, and uh...
FRIGGA : What are you wearing?
THOR: I always wear this. This is one of my favorites.
[Frigga puts her hand on Thor's face and takes a good look at him}
FRIGGA : What's wrong with your eye?
THOR: Oh, my eye. That's... you remember the Battle of Haroquin? When I got hit in the face with a broadsword?
FRIGGA : You're not the Thor I know at all, are you?
THOR:  Yes, I am.
FRIGGA : The future hasn't been kind to you, has it?
THOR: I didn't say I'm from the future.
FRIGGA : I was raised by witches, boy. I see with more than eyes, and you know that.
THOR:  I am totally, totally from the future.
FRIGGA : Yes, you are.
THOR: I really need to talk to you.
FRIGGA : We can talk.
THOR: His head was over there... His body over there... What was the point? I was too late. I was just standing there. Some idiot with an axe.
FRIGGA : You're no idiot. You're here aren't you? Seeking counsel from the wisest person in Asgard.
THOR: I guess, yeah.
FRIGGA : Idiot? No. A failure? Absolutely.
THOR: That's a little bit harsh.
FRIGGA : You do know what that makes you? Just like everyone else.
THOR: I'm not supposed to be like everyone else, am I?
FRIGGA : Everyone fails at who they are supposed to be, Thor. The measure of a person, of a hero, is how well they succeed at being who they are.
THOR: I really missed you, Mum.
ROCKET: Thor! I got it!
ASGARDIAN SOLDIER : Get that rabbit!
THOR: Ma, I have to tell you something.
FRIGGA : No, son. You don't. You're here to repair your future, not mine.
THOR: But this is about your future.
FRIGGA : It's none of my business.
ROCKET: Hey. You must be Mom. I got the thing. Come on, we got to move.
THOR: I wish we had more time.
FRIGGA : No, this was a gift. And you're going to be the man you're meant to be.
THOR: I love you, Mom.
FRIGGA : I love you. And eat a salad.
ROCKET: Come on. We gotta go.
FRIGGA :  Goodbye.
ROCKET: Three... two...
THOR: No, wait!
ROCKET:  Wh- what am I looking at?
FRIGGA : Oh, sometimes it takes a second.
THOR:  I'm still worthy.
ROCKET: Oh, boy.
THOR: Goodbye, Mom.
FRIGGA :  Goodbye.
RHODEY: So he's an idiot?
NEBULA: Yeah.
RHODEY: What's that?
NEBULA: The tool of a thief.
RHODEY: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa...This is the part where spikes come out with skeletons on the end and everything...
NEBULA: What are you talking about?
RHODEY: When you break into a place called the temple of the Power Stone, There's gonna be a bunch of booby traps–
RHODEY: Okay. All right. Go ahead.

BRUCE : You murdered trillions!
THANOS : You should be grateful.
NATASHA : Where are the stones?
THANOS : Gone. Reduced to atoms.
BRUCE : You used them two days ago.
THANOS : I used the stones to destroy the stones. It nearly killed me. But the work is done. It always will be. I am inevitable.
GAMORA : What did you do to them?
THANOS : Nothing. Yet. They're not trying to stop something I'm going to do in our time. They're trying to undo something I've already done in theirs.

Tony Stark: Cap–
Tony Stark: Sorry, buddy. We got a– problem.
SCOTT LANG: Huh. Yeah, we do.
STEVE ROGERS: Well, what are we gonna do now?
Tony Stark: You know what? Give me a break, Steve. I just got hit in the head with the Hulk.
SCOTT LANG: You said that we had one shot. This– this was our shot. We shot it. It's shot. Six stones or nothing. Six stones or nothing–
Tony Stark: You're repeating yourself, you know that? You're repeating yourself.
SCOTT LANG: You're repeating yourself. You're repeating yourself. You know– No.
Tony Stark: Dude, come on.
SCOTT LANG: You never wanted a time heist, you went on board with the time heist–
Tony Stark: I dropped the ball.
SCOTT LANG: You ruined the time heist.
Tony Stark: Is that what I did?
SCOTT LANG: Yeah!
STEVE ROGERS: Are there any other options with the Tesseract?
SCOTT LANG: No, no, no. There's no other options. There's no do-overs. We're not going anywhere else. We have one particle left. Each. That's it, alright? We use that– Bye, bye. You're not going home.
STEVE ROGERS: Yeah, well if we don't try, then no one else is going home, either.
Tony Stark: I got it. There's another way. To retake the Tesseract and acquire new particles. We'll stroll down memory lane. Military installation, Garden State.
STEVE ROGERS: When were they both there?
Tony Stark: They were there at a– I've a vaguely exact idea.
STEVE ROGERS: How vague?
SCOTT LANG: What are you talking about? Where are we going?
Tony Stark: I know for a fact they were there–
SCOTT LANG: Who's they? What are we doing?
Tony Stark: And I know how I know.
SCOTT LANG: Guys, what's up? What is it?
Tony Stark: Well, it looks like we're improvising.

STEVE ROGERS: The idea of me was.
Tony Stark: Right. Well, imagine you're SHIELD, running a quasi-fascistic intelligence organization. Where do you hide it?
STEVE ROGERS: In plain sight.
Tony Stark:  Good luck on your mission, Captain.
STEVE ROGERS:  Good luck on your project, doctor.
ELEVATOR LADY: You're new here?
STEVE ROGERS: Not exactly.

Tony Stark: Oh, yeah.
HOWARD STARK: I'm looking for Dr. Zola. Have you seen him?
Tony Stark: Yeah, no, Dr. Zol– No, I haven't seen a soul.  Pardon me.
HOWARD STARK: Do I know you?
Tony Stark: No, sir. I'm a– a visitor from MIT.
HOWARD STARK: Huh. MIT. Got a name?
Tony Stark: Uh– Howard.
HOWARD STARK: Well, that'll be easy to remember.
Tony Stark: Howard– Potts.

Tony Stark: Hi.
HOWARD STARK: Shake it, don't pull it.
Tony Stark: Yeah–
HOWARD STARK: You look a little green around the gills there, Potts.

HANK PYM: I'm confused. I thought that was your job.
CAPTAIN STEVENS : Well, it's just– Sir, the box is glowing and, to be honest, some of our mail guys aren't feeling that great.
HANK PYM: They didn't open it, did they?
CAPTAIN STEVENS : Yeah, they did. You better get down here.
HANK PYM: Excuse me! Out of the way!
Tony Stark: So, flowers and sauerkraut. You got a big date tonight?

HOWARD STARK: Thanks. Hold this, will you?
Tony Stark: Yeah, sure. How far along is she?
HOWARD STARK: I don't know– Uh– She's at the point where she can't stand the sound of my chewing. I guess I'll be eating dinner in the pantry again.
Tony Stark: I have a little girl.
HOWARD STARK: A girl would be nice. Less of a chance she'd turn out exactly like me.
Tony Stark: What'd be so awful about that?
HOWARD STARK: Let's just say that the greater good has rarely outweighed my own self-interests.
SECURITY OFFICER: And you've never seen these two men before?
ELEVATOR LADY: No, I've got an eye for this. The two of them looked fishy.
SECURITY OFFICER: Can you describe them?
ELEVATOR LADY: Well, one of them had a hippie beard.
SECURITY OFFICER: Hippie? Like Bee Gees or Mungo Jerry?
ELEVATOR LADY: Definitely Mungo Jerry.
SECURITY OFFICER: Yeah, this is Chesler. I need every available MPs on sub-level 6. We have a potential breach.
Tony Stark: So, where are you at with names?
HOWARD STARK: Well, if it's a boy, my wife likes Elmonzo.
Tony Stark: Huh, Might wanna let that stew awwhile. You got time.
HOWARD STARK: Let me ask you a question. When your kid was born– were you nervous?
Tony Stark: Wildly. Yeah.
HOWARD STARK: Did you feel qualified? Like you had any idea how to successfully operate that thing?
Tony Stark: I literally pieced it together as I went along, I thought about what my Dad did, and–
HOWARD STARK: My old man, he never met a problem he couldn't solve with a belt.
Tony Stark: I thought my dad was tough on me. And now, looking back, I just remember the good stuff, you know. He did drop the odd pearl.
HOWARD STARK: Yeah? Like what?
Tony Stark: "No amount of money ever bought a second of time."
HOWARD STARK: Smart guy.
Tony Stark: He did his best.
HOWARD STARK: Let me tell you. That kid's not even here yet, and there's nothing I wouldn't do for him. Good to meet you, Potts.
Tony Stark: Yeah, Howard– Everything's gonna be all right. Thank you– for everything– you've done for this country.
HOWARD STARK: Jarvis, have we ever met that guy?
EDWIN JARVIS: You meet a lot of people, sir.
HOWARD STARK: Seems very familiar. Weird beard.
NEBULA : You're weak.
NEBULA: I'm you.
throws a punch straight at Present Nebula. Gamora  walks into the room.]
NEBULA: You can stop this. You know you want to. Did you see what happens in the future? Thanos finds the Soul Stone. You wanna know how he does that? You wanna know what he does to you?
NEBULA : That's enough.  You disgust me. But that doesn't mean you're useless.
steals the golden plate on the side of Present Nebula´s face and wears it herself. Then she walks up to Thanos, gives him a Pym Particle and shows him her new look.]
NEBULA : How do I look?
CLINT BARTON: Wow– Under different circumstances, this would be totally awesome.
NATASHA ROMANOFF: I bet the raccoon didn't have to climb a mountain. CLINT BARTON: Technically, he's not a raccoon, you know.
NATASHA ROMANOFF: Whatever. He eats garbage.
RED SKULL : Welcome.
RED SKULL : Natasha, daughter of Ivan. Clint, son of Edith.
NATASHA ROMANOFF: Who are you?
RED SKULL : Consider me a guide. To you, and to all who seek the Soul Stone.
NATASHA ROMANOFF: Oh, good. You tell us where it is. Then we'll be on our way.
RED SKULL : Ah, liebchen– If only it were that easy.
RED SKULL : What you seek lies in front of you... as does what you fear.
NATASHA ROMANOFF: The stone is down there.
RED SKULL : For one of you. For the other... In order to take the stone, you must lose that which you love. An everlasting exchange. A soul, for a soul.
CLINT BARTON: How's it going? Jesus...Maybe he's making this shit up.
NATASHA ROMANOFF: No. I don't think so.
CLINT BARTON: Why, 'cause he knows your Daddy's name?
NATASHA ROMANOFF: I didn't. Thanos left here with the stone without his daughter. It's not a coincidence.
CLINT BARTON: Yeah.
NATASHA ROMANOFF: Whatever it takes.
CLINT BARTON: Whatever it takes.
NATASHA ROMANOFF: If we don't get that stone, billions of people stay dead.
CLINT BARTON: Then I guess we both know who it's gotta be.
NATASHA ROMANOFF: I guess we do.
CLINT BARTON: I'm starting to think– we mean different people here, Natasha.
NATASHA ROMANOFF: For the last five years I've been trying to do one thing: Get to right here. That's all it's been about. Bringing everybody back.
CLINT BARTON: Oh, don't you get all decent on me now.
NATASHA ROMANOFF: What, you think I wanna do it? I'm trying to save your life, you idiot.
CLINT BARTON: Yeah, well, I don't want you to, because I– Natasha, you know what I've done. You know what I've become.
NATASHA ROMANOFF: I don't judge people on their worst mistakes.
CLINT BARTON: Maybe you should.
NATASHA ROMANOFF: You didn't.
CLINT BARTON: You're a pain in my ass, you know that?
CLINT BARTON: Okay. You win.
CLINT BARTON: Tell my family I love them.
NATASHA ROMANOFF: You tell them yourself.
CLINT BARTON: Damn you!
NATASHA ROMANOFF: Let me go.
CLINT BARTON: No. Please, no.
NATASHA ROMANOFF: It's okay.
CLINT BARTON: Please–  NO!!!
BRUCE BANNER: Did we get them all?
RHODEY: You telling me this'll actually work?
BRUCE BANNER: Clint, where's Nat?
Tony Stark: Do we know if she had family?
STEVE ROGERS: Yeah. Us.
THOR:  What?
Tony Stark: I just asked him a question–
THOR: Yeah, you're acting like she's dead. Why are we acting like she's dead? We have the stones, right? As long as we have the stones, Cap, we can bring her back, isn't that right?  So stop this shit. We're the Avengers, get it together.
CLINT BARTON: We can't get her back.
THOR: Wha– what?
CLINT BARTON: It can't be undone. It can't.
THOR: I'm sorry. No offense, but you're a very earthly being. Okay? We're talking about space magic. And "can't" seems very definitive don't you think?
CLINT BARTON:  Yeah, look, I know that I'm way outside my paygrade here. But she still isn't here, is she?
THOR: No, that's my point–
CLINT BARTON: It can't– be undone. Or that's at least what the red floating guy had to say.  Maybe you wanna go talk to him, okay? GO GRAB YOUR HAMMER, AND YOU GO FLY AND TALK TO HIM!
CLINT BARTON: It was supposed to be me. She sacrificed her life for that goddamn stone. She bet her life on it.
BRUCE BANNER: She's not coming back. We have to make it worth it. We have to.
STEVE ROGERS: We will.
ROCKET: Boom!
ROCKET: All right. The glove's ready. Question is, who's gonna snap their freaking fingers?
THOR: I'll do it.
SCOTT LANG: Excuse me?
THOR: It's okay.
EVERYONE:  No, no, no, whoa. Stop. Stop. Wait a sec. Hey, hey–
STEVE ROGERS: Wait, wait, Thor, just wait. We haven't decided who's gonna put that on yet. THOR: I'm sorry. What, we're just sitting around waiting for the right opportunity?
SCOTT LANG: We should at least discuss it.
THOR: No, no, sitting here staring at that thing is not gonna bring everybody back. I'm the strongest Avenger, okay? So this responsibility falls upon me. It's my duty.
Tony Stark: It's not about that–
THOR:  It's not that– Stop it! Just let me!  Just let me do it. Just let me do something good. Something right.
Tony Stark: Look– It's not just the fact that that glove is channeling enough energy to light up a continent, I'm telling you, you're in no condition.
THOR: What do you– What do you think is coursing through my veins right now?
RHODEY: Cheez Whiz?
THOR: Lightning.
Tony Stark: Yeah.
BRUCE: Lightning won't help you, pal. It's gotta be me.
BRUCE BANNER: You saw what those stones did to Thanos. It almost killed him. None of you could survive.
STEVE ROGERS: How do we know you will?
BRUCE BANNER: We don't. But the radiation's mostly gamma.  It's like...I was made for this.
sneaks off to the Quantum portal and activates it]
Tony Stark: Good to go, yeah?
BRUCE BANNER: Let's do it.
Tony Stark: You remember– everyone Thanos snapped away five years ago and just bringing them back to now, today. Don't change anything from the last five years.
BRUCE BANNER: Got it.
Tony Stark: F.R.I.D.A.Y., do me a favor and activate Barn Door Protocol. Will you?
F.R.I.D.A.Y.: Yes, boss.
BRUCE BANNER: Everybody comes home.
THOR: Take it off! Take it off!
STEVE ROGERS: No, wait. Bruce, are you okay?
Tony Stark: Talk to me, Banner.
BRUCE BANNER: I'm okay. I'm okay.
opening the Quantum Tunnel and brings the Sanctuary II to the present. Bruce screams, fighting through the intense pain coursing through his body courtesy of the gauntlet, and manages to snap his fingers. He faints and the gauntlet slides off his arm, Clint kicks it away.]
STEVE ROGERS: Bruce!
Tony Stark: Don't move him.
BRUCE ROGERS:  Did it work?
THOR: Worth a shot. It's over. It's okay.
CLINT BARTON:  Honey. Honey.
SCOTT LANG: Guys– I think it worked!
ROCKET: I can't breathe. I can't breathe! I can't breathe.
RHODEY: Canopy. Canopy. Canopy.
BRUCE BANNER: Rhodey, Rocket, get outta here!
ROCKET: Hurry up! Hurry up! Come on!
BRUCE BANNER: Rhodey!
RHODEY: Mayday, mayday! Does anybody copy? We're in the lower level, it's flooding!
SCOTT LANG: What?
RHODEY: We're drowning! Does anybody copy? Mayday!
SCOTT LANG: Wait! I'm here! I'm here, can you hear me?
CLINT BARTON: Cap?
CLINT BARTON:  Damn.

THANOS : Daughter.
NEBULA : Yes, Father.
THANOS : So, this is the future. Well done.
takes off the orange plate on her head and throws it away]
NEBULA : Thank you, Father. They suspected nothing.
plants his double-bladed sword on the ground, takes off his helmet and places on top of the sword's edge.]
THANOS : The arrogant never do.
THANOS : Go. Find the stones. Bring them to me.
NEBULA : What will you do?
THANOS : Wait.
proceeds to go find the stones and the camera pans over the Sanctuary II and we see Gamora  watching. Gamora  heads over to where Nebula is being held prisoner.]
GAMORA : Tell me something. In the future, what happens to you and me?
NEBULA: I tried to kill you. Several times.
rolls her eyes]
NEBULA: But eventually, we become friends. We become sisters.
holds out her hand.]
GAMORA : Come on. We can stop him.
Tony Stark: Come on, buddy. Wake up. That's my man.  You lose this again, I'm keeping it.
STEVE ROGERS: What happened?
Tony Stark: You messed with time. It tends to mess back. You'll see.
from a distance.]
Tony Stark: What's he been doing?
THOR: Absolutely nothing.
STEVE ROGERS: Where are the stones?
Tony Stark: Somewhere under all this. All I know is he doesn't have them.
STEVE ROGERS: So we keep it that way.
THOR: You know it's a trap, right?
Tony Stark: Yeah. And I don't much care.
THOR: Good. Just as long we are all in agreement. . His casual clothes transform into his armour and cape, with his beard getting some braid treatment.] Let's kill him properly this time.
THANOS : You could not live with your own failure. And where did that bring you? Back to me. I thought by eliminating half of life, the other half would thrive. But you’ve shown me that’s impossible. And as long as there are those that remember what was, there will always be those that are unable to accept what can be. They will resist.
Tony Stark: Yep. We're all kinds of stubborn.
THANOS : I'm thankful. Because now, I know what I must do.  I will shred this universe down to its last atom.  puts on his helmet] And then– With the stones you've collected for me, create a new one. Teeming with life, but knows not what it has lost but only what it has been given.  A grateful universe.
STEVE ROGERS: Born out of blood.
THANOS : They'll never know it. Because you won't be alive to tell them.
. Meanwhile, Hulk is under all of the mess trying to hold up the structure. Rhodey and Rocket are breathing for their lives.]
RHODEY: See you on the other side, man.
SCOTT LANG: Hang on! I'm coming!
CLINT BARTON: Oh, hey– I know you.
NEBULA: Father.
NEBULA : I have the stones.
CLINT BARTON: What?!
steps her foot down on him an points her gun at him]
GAMORA : Stop.
come around the corner]
NEBULA : You're betraying us?
. Nebula  points her gun at her future self]
NEBULA: You don't have to do this.
NEBULA : I am this.
GAMORA : No, you're not.
NEBULA: You've seen what we become.
GAMORA : Nebula, listen to her.
NEBULA: You can change.
NEBULA : He won't let me.
points a gun at Gamora ]
GAMORA : NO!
and she dies. Hawkeye picks up the Infinity Gauntlet]
Tony Stark: Okay, Thor. Hit me.
F.R.I.D.A.Y: Boss, wake up!
starts to float off the ground while Thanos is digging it into Thor, when suddenly Mjolnir flies into Thanos, zooms past, stops, and flies back, both look on in amazement as Steve picks up the hammer.]
THOR: I knew it!
kicks Thor to the ground and proceed to battle Steve dual wielding both his shield and Mjolnir ]
and hitting Thanos in the face knocking him down. Steve throws his shield and Thanos  deflects, Steve throws Mjolnir  to his shield creating a shockwave and knocking Thanos  off his feet. Steve goes on the offensive on Thanos, throwing his shield first at Thanos and quickly hitting it back at him again with Mjolnir. He lines his arm back up and underarms a channel of lightning on Thanos who eventually gets the upper hand as he removes his helmet, stabs Steve on the leg and knocks Mjolnir  out of his hand. Thanos proceed to destroy Steve's shield with his double-bladed sword and throws him across the battlefield.]
THANOS : In all my years of conquest– violence– slaughter– It was never personal. But I'll tell you now– what I'm about to do to your stubborn, annoying little planet– I'm gonna enjoy it. Very, very much.
entire army is summons to the ground which include the Children of Thanos, Chitauri, Sakaarans, Outriders and Chitauri Gorillas. Upon seeing the army descending on Earth, Steve slowly gets back to his feet. With a fierce determination, he tightens his broken shield to his arm and stands against Thanos' giant army alone. Suddenly, a crackling comes in on his communicator.]
SAM WILSON: Hey, Cap, you read me?
SAM WILSON: Cap, it's Sam. Can you hear me?
SAM WILSON: On your left.
arrive. Nearly every hero has magically been transported to the battlefield to face Thanos' hordes.]
DOCTOR STRANGE: Is that everyone?
WONG: What, you wanted more?
STEVE ROGERS: AVENGERS!  –assemble.
THOR: No, no, give me that. You have the little one.
PETER PARKER: Hey! Holy cow! You will not believe what's been going on. Do you remember when we were in space? And I got all dusty? I must've passed out, Because I woke up, and you were gone. But Doctor Strange was there, right? He was like, "It's been five years. Come on, they need us." And then he started doing the yellow sparkly thing that he does all the time– Tony Stark: He did? Oh, God.
PETER PARKER: What are you doing?
PETER PARKER: Oh, this is nice.
PETER QUILL: Gamora? I thought I lost you.
PETER QUILL: Ow.
GAMORA :  Don't– touch–  me!
PETER QUILL: You missed the first time– Then you got them both the second time.
GAMORA :  This is the one? Seriously?
NEBULA: The choices were him, or a tree.
CLINT BARTON: Cap, what do you want me to do with this damn thing?
STEVE ROGERS: Get those stones as far away as possible!
BRUCE BANNER: No! We need to get them back where they came from.
Tony Stark: No way to get them back. Thanos destroyed the quantum tunnel.
SCOTT LANG: Hold on!  That wasn't our only time machine.
STEVE ROGERS: Anyone see an ugly, brown van up there?
VALKYRIE: Yes! But you're not gonna like where it's parked!
Tony Stark: Scott, how long you need to get that thing working?
SCOTT LANG: Maybe ten minutes.
STEVE ROGERS: Get it started. We'll get the stones to you.
HOPE VAN DYNE: We're on it, Cap.
Tony Stark: Hey. You said one out of 14 million, we win, yeah? Tell me this is it.
DOCTOR STRANGE: If I tell you what happens, it won't happen.
Tony Stark: You better be right.
THE WASP: It's a mess back here.
SCOTT LANG: It's– it's dead.
THE WASP: What?
SCOTT LANG: It's dead. I have to hotwire it.
THANOS : Where's Nebula?
CORVUS GLAIVE: She's not responding.
EBONY MAW :  Sire!
T'CHALLA: Clint! Give it to me.
WANDA MAXIMOFF: You took everything from me.
THANOS : I don't even know who you are.
WANDA MAXIMOFF: You will.
PETER PARKER: I got it!
PETER PARKER: Activate Instant Kill!
THANOS : Rain fire!
CORVUS GLAIVE: But sire, our troops!
THANOS : Just do it!
PEPPER POTTS: Uh, is anyone else seeing this?
PETER PARKER: I got this. I got this! Okay, I don't got this. Help! Somebody, help!
STEVE: Hey, Queens, heads up.
PEPPER POTTS: Hang on. I got you, kid.
PETER PARKER: Hey! Nice to meet you– OH, MY GOD!
SAM: What the hell is this?
Tony Stark: F.R.I.D.A.Y., what are they firing at?
F.R.I.D.A.Y.: Something just entered the upper atmosphere.
ROCKET: Oh, yeah!
STEVE ROGERS: Danvers, we need an assist here.
PETER PARKER: Hi. I'm– Peter Parker.
CAROL DANVERS: Hey, Peter Parker. You got something for me?
PETER PARKER:  I don't know how you're gonna get it through all that.
WANDA MAXIMOFF: Don't worry.
OKOYE: She's got help.
THANOS : I am– inevitable.
Tony Stark: And I– am– Iron Man.
PETER PARKER: Mr. Stark?  Hey– Mr. Stark? Can you hear me? It's Peter. Hey. We won, Mr. Stark– We won, Mr. Stark. We won. You did it, sir. You did it.
PETER PARKER: I'm sorry– Tony–
PEPPER POTTS: Hey.
Tony Stark:  Hey, Pep..
PEPPER POTTS: F.R.I.D.A.Y.?
F.R.I.D.A.Y.: Life functions critical.
PEPPER POTTS: Tony. Look at me.  We're gonna be okay. You can rest now.
Tony Stark: Everybody wants a happy ending, right? But it doesn't always roll that way. Maybe this time. I'm hoping if you play this back, it's in celebration. I hope families are reunited, I hope we get it back, and something like a normal version of the planet has been restored. If there ever was such a thing. God, what a world. Universe, now. If you told me ten years ago that we weren't alone, let alone, you know, to this extent, I mean, I wouldn't have been surprised. But come on, you know? The epic forces of darkness and light that have come into play. And, for better or worse, that's the reality Morgan's gonna have to find a way to grow up in.
Tony Stark: So I thought I'd probably better record a little greeting... In the case of an untimely death on my part. I mean, not that, death at any time isn't untimely. This time travel thing that we're gonna try and pull off tomorrow, it's– it's got me scratching my head about the survivability of it all. That's the thing. Then again, that's the hero gig. Part of the journey is the end.  What am I even trippin' for? Everything's gonna work out exactly the way it's supposed to.  I love you 3,000.
CLINT: You know, I wish there was a way– that I could let her know. That we won.  We did it.
WANDA MAXIMOFF: She knows– They both do.
HAPPY: How you doing, Squirt?
MORGAN STARK: Good.
HAPPY: You good? Okay. You hungry?
MORGAN STARK: Mm. Hm.
HAPPY: What do you want?
MORGAN STARK: Cheeseburgers.
HAPPY: You know your dad liked cheeseburgers? I'm gonna get you all the cheeseburgers you want.
MORGAN STARK: Okay.
VALKYRIE: So, when can we expect you back?
THOR: Um– about that–
VALKYRIE: Thor. Your people need a king.
THOR: No, they already have one.
VALKYRIE: That's funny. You're being serious?
THOR: It's time for me to be who I am rather than who I'm supposed to be. But you, you're a leader. That's who you are.
VALKYRIE: You know I'd make a lot of changes around here.
THOR: I'm counting on it. Your Majesty.
VALKYRIE: What will you do?
THOR: I'm not sure. For the first time in a thousand years, I– I have no path. I do have a ride, though.
ROCKET: Move it or lose it, hairbag.
THOR: Well, here we are. Tree! Good to see you. Well–  The Asgardians of the Galaxy, back together again. Where to first?
QUILL: Hey, just so you know, this is my ship still. I'm in charge.
THOR: I know. I know. Of course, you are. Of course.
QUILL: See, you say of course, but then you touch the map. It makes you think that maybe you didn't realize I was in charge.
THOR: Quail– you– that– that's your own–
QUILL: Quail?
THOR: –insecurities in there. Okay? I'm merely trying to be of service and assisting.
QUILL: It's Quill.
THOR: That's what I said.
DRAX: You should fight one another for the honor of leadership.
NEBULA: Sounds fair.
QUILL: It's not necessary.
THOR: It's not.
QUILL: Okay?
ROCKET: I got some blasters, unless you guys wanna use knives.
MANTIS:  Oooh, yes. Please, use knives.
DRAX: Yeah, knives.
GROOT: I am Groot.
QUILL: Not necessary...
THOR: There shall be no knifing one another. Everybody knows who's in charge.
QUILL:  Me, right?
THOR: Yes, you. Of course. Of course. Of course.
BRUCE BANNER: Now, remember– You have to return the stones to the exact moment you got them. Or you're gonna open up a bunch of nasty alternative realities.
STEVE ROGERS: Don't worry, Bruce. Clip all the branches.
BRUCE BANNER: You know, I tried. When I had the gauntlet, the stones, I really tried to bring her back.  I miss her, man.
STEVE ROGERS: Me, too.
Sam Wilson: You know, if you want, I can come with you.
STEVE ROGERS: You're a good man, Sam. This one's on me, though.
STEVE ROGERS: Don't do anything stupid 'till I get back.
BUCKY BARNES: How can I? You're taking all the stupid with you.
BUCKY BARNES: Gonna miss you, Buddy.
STEVE ROGERS: It's gonna be okay, Buck.
Sam Wilson: How long is this gonna take?
BRUCE BANNER: For him? As long as he needs. For us? Five seconds.
BRUCE BANNER: Ready, Cap? Alright. We'll meet you back here, okay?
STEVE ROGERS: You bet.
BRUCE BANNER: Going quantum. Three, two, one–
BRUCE BANNER: And returning in, five, four, three, two, one–
Sam Wilson: Where is he?
BRUCE BANNER: I don't know. He blew right by his time stamp. He should be here.
Sam Wilson: Well, get him back.
BRUCE BANNER: I'm trying.
Sam Wilson: Get him the hell back!
BRUCE BANNER: Hey, I said, I'm trying!
BUCKY BARNES: Sam...
BUCKY BARNES: Go ahead.
Sam Wilson: Cap?
STEVE ROGERS: Hi, Sam.
Sam Wilson: So did something go wrong, or did something go right?
STEVE ROGERS: Well, after I put the stones back, I thought, maybe I'll try some of that life Tony was telling me to get.
Sam Wilson: How'd that work out for you?
STEVE ROGERS: It was beautiful.
Sam Wilson: I'm happy for you. Truly.
STEVE ROGERS: Thank you.
Sam Wilson: Only thing bumming me out is the fact I have to live in a world without Captain America.
STEVE ROGERS: Oh, That reminds me.  Try it on.
STEVE ROGERS: How does it feel?
Sam Wilson: Like it's someone else's.
STEVE ROGERS: It isn't.
Sam Wilson: Thank you. I'll do my best.
STEVE ROGERS: That's why it's yours.
Sam Wilson:  You wanna tell me about her?
STEVE ROGERS:  No. No, I don't think I will.
